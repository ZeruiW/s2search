We show that this compact neuron can naturally implement generic logic gates, including XOR. A simulated oscillator-based neural network is then shown to achieve results equivalent to standard approaches on two reference classification tasks.

Key memristor properties include a suitable non-volatile resistance range, continuous linear resistance modulation and symmetric switching. In this work, we demonstrate voltage-controlled, symmetric and analog potentiation and depression of a ferroelectric Hf0.57Zr0.43O2 (HZO) field effect transistor (FeFET) with good linearity. Our FeFET operates with a low writing energy (fJ) and fast programming time (40 ns).

Compared to the parallel perceptron architecture trained by the p-delta algorithm, which is the state of the art in terms of performance of readout stages, our readout architecture and learning algorithm can attain better performance with significantly less synaptic resources making it attractive for VLSI implementation. Inspired by the nonlinear properties of dendrites in biological neurons, our readout stage incorporates neurons having multiple dendrites with a lumped nonlinearity (two compartment model). The number of synaptic connections on each branch is significantly lower than the total number of connections from the liquid neurons and the learning algorithm tries to find the best `combination' of input connections on each branch to reduce the error. Hence, the learning involves network rewiring (NRW) of the readout network similar to structural plasticity observed in its biological counterparts. We show that compared to a single perceptron using analog weights, this architecture for the readout can attain, even by using the same number of binary valued synapses, up to 3.3 times less error for a two-class spike train classification problem and 2.4 times less error for an input rate approximation task. Even with 60 times larger synapses, a group of 60 parallel perceptrons cannot attain the performance of the proposed dendritically enhanced readout. An additional advantage of this method for hardware implementations is that the `choice' of connectivity can be easily implemented exploiting address event representation (AER) protocols commonly used in current neuromorphic systems where the connection matrix is stored in memory. Also, due to the use of binary synapses, our proposed method is more robust against statistical variations.", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems", "authors": ["Subhrajit  Roy", "Amitava  Banerjee", "Arindam  Basu"], "year": 2014, "n_citations": 35}

Quaternary structure assembles deterministically and performs a wide range of important functions in the cell, whereas protein aggregation is the hallmark of a number of diseases and represents a nondeterministic self-assembly process. Here we build on previous work on a lattice model of deterministic self-assembly to investigate nondeterministic self-assembly of single lattice tiles and mixtures of two tiles at varying relative concentrations. Despite limiting the simplicity of the model to two interface types, which results in 13 topologically distinct single tiles and 106 topologically distinct sets of two tiles, we observe a wide variety of concentration-dependent behaviors. Several two-tile sets display critical behaviors in the form of a sharp transition from bound to unbound structures as the relative concentration of one tile to another increases. Other sets exhibit gradual monotonic changes in structural density, or nonmonotonic changes, while again others show no concentration dependence at all. We catalog this extensive range of behaviors and present a model that provides a reasonably good estimate of the critical concentrations for a subset of the critical transitions. In addition, we show that the structures resulting from these tile sets are fractal, with one of two different fractal dimensions.", "venue": "Physical review. E", "authors": ["S.

At present this challenge is viewed in terms of two distinct architectural components: a computational substrate and a heat-exchange substrate. Typically these two components are viewed as performing conceptually different functions that are independent up to optimization constraints applied when they are jointly implemented. Next-generation computing architectures, by contrast, must be designed from the perspective of computing as a thermodynamic process that can be managed in such a way as to actively control when and where heat is generated. The fundamental connection between computation and thermodynamics is not new. It dates back to Landaur\u2019s principle from 1961 [1], which says that a computational process is thermodynamically neutral until information is destroyed. More specifically, what is thought of as an erasure of a bit is actually a process by which information is irreversibly transformed to heat. According to Landaur\u2019s principle a fully reversible computational process will not produce heat because no information is destroyed (if information were destroyed then by definition the process could not be reversed). Reversible logic gates have been developed and studied [2, 3], especially recently in the context of quantum computing, and are designed to physically store information that would otherwise be lost. Said another way, they store the ancillary information needed for a conventional logic operation to be undone/reversed. The limitation of reversible computing is, of course, that the amount of stored information will tend to increase without bound during execution of any nontrivial algorithm. What is important to notice is that this ancillary information can be destroyed \u2013 i.e., converted to heat \u2013 or not at the discretion of the system. Beyond simple erase or don\u2019t-erase discretion, the ancillary information retained to allow reversibility can, at the discretion of the system, be transported like any other information from one physical memory location to another. In principle, therefore, information can be scheduled for erasure and then be transported freely to physical locations where it can be converted to heat (erased) upon arrival with minimal impact on the ongoing computational process. To summarize, conventional computing hardware generates heat as a continuous by-product of the operation of logic gates during execution of a program. The precise distribution of heat is therefore a function of the particular algorithm and is not generally knowable a priori, thus the heat-dissipation substrate must be designed under an assumption that pernicious heat accumulation (spikes) can occur anywhere across the physical area in which logic operations may be performed. This need to uniformly maintain separate computation and heatsink functionality within the same physical space is why heat dissipation continues to limit the density and/or frequency of logic operations. An entropy-controlled computing architecture (ECCA) would permit the time and location at which heat is generated to be actively controlled during the computational process rather than letting it be indiscriminately generated at gate locations with an expectation that a separate physical system will soak it up. In the ECCA model the ancillary bits that are conventionally thought of as being stored as part of the operation of each reversible logic gate are now treated as bits of unneeded information that must be taken away in a manner somewhat analogous to garbage collection. More specifically, an unneeded bit could be sent without erasure to a nearby unused memory location or it could be sent to a location at which there is available capacity to accommodate the heat resulting from its erasure. Continuing with the analogy to garbage collection for memory management, the ECCA processing of a given program could progress without heat generation until storage for waste bits has been exhausted, at which point the computational process could be halted until the bits are erased in batch and the resulting heat is dissipated. Alternatively, waste bits could be incrementally transported for erasure at locations selected so that heat is generated uniformly across a physical area and can dissipate without localized accumulation. Batch-mode ECCA is potentially attractive for space-based applications in which heat distribution is easier to monitor than to control and the objective is to maximize the average rate of computation.

Unfortunately, certain NVMs such as phase change memory (PCM) require high voltages for correct operation. These voltages are supplied from an on-chip charge pump. If the charge pump is activated too frequently, its internal CMOS devices do not recover from stress, accelerating their aging and leading to negative bias temperature instability (NBTI) generated defects. Forcefully discharging the stressed charge pump can lower the aging rate of its CMOS devices, but makes the neuromorphic hardware unavailable to perform computations while its charge pump is being discharged. This negatively impacts performance such as latency and accuracy of the machine learning workload being executed. In this letter, we propose a novel framework to exploit workload-specific performance and lifetime trade-offs in neuromorphic computing. Our framework first extracts the precise times at which a charge pump in the hardware is activated to support neural computations within a workload. This timing information is then used with a characterized NBTI reliability model to estimate the charge pump's aging during the workload execution. We use our framework to evaluate workload-specific performance and reliability impacts of using 1) different SNN mapping strategies and 2) different charge pump discharge strategies.

It is mathematically shown here that a swarm of BAs has the universal function approximation property and can accurately approximate functions. It is then analytically demonstrated that a swarm of BAs can be easily reprogrammed to compute desired functions simply by adjusting the concentrations of BAs in the environment. We further propose a specific structure for BAs which enable them to perform distributed computing such as in the aqueous environment of living tissues and nanomedicine. The hardware complexity of this structure aims to remain low to be more reasonably realizable by today\u2019s technology. Finally, the performance of the proposed approach is illustrated by a simulation example.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Alireza  Rowhanimanesh", "Mohammad-R  Akbarzadeh-T"], "year": 2021, "n_citations": 0}

Even though there has been extensive theoretical research toward nanoscale MC, there are no examples of implemented nanoscale MC networks. The main reason for this lies in the peculiarities of nanoscale physics, challenges in nanoscale fabrication, and highly stochastic nature of the biochemical domain of envisioned nanonetwork applications. This mandates developing novel device architectures and communication methods compatible with MC constraints. To that end, various transmitter and receiver designs for MC have been proposed in the literature together with numerable modulation, coding, and detection techniques. However, these works fall into domains of a very wide spectrum of disciplines, including, but not limited to, information and communication theory, quantum physics, materials science, nanofabrication, physiology, and synthetic biology.

Particularly, we observe that the CNFETbased cache latency distribution is closely related to the LLC layouts. For the two typical LLC layouts that have the CNT growth direction aligned to the cache way direction and cache set direction respectively, we proposed variation-aware set aligned (VASA) cache and variation-aware way aligned (VAWA) cache in combination with corresponding cache optimizations such as data shuffling and page mapping to enable low-latency cache for frequently used data.

However, such a monolithic assembly limits the computational power due to signal interdependency and the resulting correlated readouts. Here, we introduce an approach that hierarchically composes a set of interconnected memristive networks into a larger reservoir.

The last aspect implies that the compilation depends not only on the algorithm, but also on hardware properties like connectivity. Here we suggest a two-step approach in which logical gates are initially scheduled neglecting connectivity considerations, while routing operations are added at a later step in a way that minimizes their overhead. We rephrase the subtasks of gate scheduling in terms of graph problems like edge-coloring and maximum subgraph isomorphism. While this approach is general, we specialize to a one dimensional array of qubits to propose a routing scheme that is minimal in the number of exchange operations.

In particular, we review neuromorphic circuits for emulating neural and synaptic dynamics in real time and discuss the role of biophysically realistic temporal dynamics in hardware neural processing architectures; we review the challenges of realizing spike-based plasticity mechanisms in real physical systems and present examples of analog electronic circuits that implement them;we describe the computational properties of recurrent neural networks and show how neuromorphic winner-take-all circuits can implement working-memory and decision-making mechanisms. We validate the neuromorphic approach proposed with experimental results obtained from our own circuits and systems, and argue how the circuits and networks presented in this work represent a useful set of components for efficiently and elegantly implementing neuromorphic cognition.", "venue": "Proceedings of the IEEE", "authors": ["Elisabetta  Chicca", "Fabio  Stefanini", "Chiara  Bartolozzi", "Giacomo  Indiveri"], "year": 2014, "n_citations": 300}

Molecular communication between biological entities is a new paradigm in communications. Recently, we studied molecular communication between two nodes formed from synthetic bacteria. Due to high randomness in behavior of bacteria, we used a population of them in each node. The reliability of such communication systems depends on both the maximum concentration of molecules that a transmitter node is able to produce at the receiver node as well as the number of bacteria in each nodes. This maximum concentration of molecules falls with distance which makes the communication to the far nodes nearly impossible. In order to alleviate this problem, in this paper, we propose to use a molecular relaying node. The relay node can resend the message either by the different or the same type of molecules as the original signal from the transmitter. We study two scenarios of relaying. In the first scenario, the relay node simply senses the received concentration and forwards it to the receiver. We show that this sense and forward scenario, depending on the type of molecules used for relaying, results in either increasing the range of concentration of molecules at the receiver or increasing the effective number of bacteria in the receiver node. For both cases of sense and forward relaying, we obtain the resulting improvement in channel capacity. We conclude that multi-type molecular relaying outperforms the single-type relaying. In the second scenario, we study the decode and forward relaying for the M-ary signaling scheme. We show that this relaying strategy increases the reliability of M-ary communication significantly.", "venue": "2013 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory", "authors": ["Arash  Einolghozati", "Mohsen  Sardari", "Faramarz  Fekri"], "year": 2013, "n_citations": 63}

Both time division multiple access (TDMA) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) schemes are considered for uplink (UL) offloading. Given the capability of IRSs in intelligently reconfiguring wireless channels over time, it is fundamentally unknown which multiple access scheme is superior for MEC UL offloading. To answer this question, we first investigate the impact of three different dynamic IRS beamforming (DIBF) schemes on the computation rate of both offloading schemes, based on the flexibility for the IRS in adjusting its beamforming (BF) vector in each transmission frame. Under the DIBF framework, computation rate maximization problems are formulated for both the NOMA and TDMA schemes, respectively, by jointly optimizing the IRS passive BF and the resource allocation. We rigorously prove that offloading adopting TDMA can achieve the same computation rate as that of NOMA, when all the devices share the same IRS BF vector during the UL offloading. By contrast, offloading exploiting TDMA outperforms NOMA, when the IRS BF vector can be flexibly adapted for UL offloading. Despite the non-convexity of the computation rate maximization problems for each DIBF scheme associated with highly coupled optimization variables, we conceive computationally efficient algorithms by invoking alternating optimization.

A central problem in the design of such systems is the need to extract information locally from sensed data on a severely limited energy budget. This necessitates the design of energy-efficient sensory embedded system. A typical sensory embedded system enforces a physical separation between sensing and computational subsystems - a separation mandated by the differing requirements of the sensing and computational functions. As a consequence, the energy consumption in such systems tends to be dominated by the energy consumed in transferring data over the sensor-processor interface (communication energy) and the energy consumed in processing the data in digital processor (computational energy). In this article, we propose an in-sensor computing architecture which (mostly) eliminates the sensor-processor interface by embedding inference computations in the noisy sensor fabric in analog and retraining the hyperparameters in order to compensate for non-ideal computations. The resulting architecture referred to as the Compute Sensor - a sensor that computes in addition to sensing - represents a radical departure from the conventional. We show that a Compute Sensor for image data can be designed by embedding both feature extraction and classification functions in the analog domain in close proximity to the CMOS active pixel sensor (APS) array. Significant gains in energy-efficiency are demonstrated using behavioral and energy models in a commercial semiconductor process technology. In the process, the Compute Sensor creates a unique opportunity to develop machine learning algorithms for information extraction from data on a noisy underlying computational fabric.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Sai  Zhang", "Mingu  Kang", "Charbel  Sakr", "Naresh R.

In the construction of reversible gates from basic gates, ancilla bits are commonly used to remove restrictions on the type of gates that a certain set of basic gates generates. With unlimited ancilla bits, many gates (such as Toffoli and Fredkin) become universal reversible gates. However, ancilla bits can be expensive to implement, thus making the problem of minimizing necessary ancilla bits a practical topic. \nThis thesis explores the problem of reversible logic synthesis using a single base gate and a few ancilla bits. Two base gates are discussed: a variation of the 3-bit Toffoli gate and the original 3-bit Fredkin gate. There are three main results associated with these two gates: i) the variated Toffoli gate can generate all n-bit reversible gates using 1 ancilla bit, ii) the variated Toffoli can generate all n-bit reversible gates that are even permutations using no ancilla bit, iii) the Fredkin gate can generate all n-bit conservative reversible gates using 1 ancilla bit. Prior to this paper, the best known result for general universality requires three basic gates, and the best known result for conservative universality needs 5 ancilla bits. The second result is trivially optimal. For the first and the third result, we explicitly prove their optimality: the variated Toffoli cannot generate all n-bit reversible gates without using any extra input lines, and the Fredkin gate cannot generate all n-bit conservative reversible gates without using extra input lines. We also explore a stronger version of the second converse by introducing a new concept called borrowed bits, and prove that the Fredkin gate cannot generate all n-bit conservative reversible gates without ancilla bits, even with an unlimited number of borrowed bits.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Siyao  Xu"], "year": 2015, "n_citations": 13}

A subexcitable BZ medium responds to asymmetric local perturbation by producing traveling localized excitation wave-fragments, distant relatives of dissipative solitons. The size and life span of an excitation wave-fragment depend on the illumination level of the medium. Under the right conditions the wave-fragments conserve their shape and velocity vectors for extended time periods. I interpret the wave-fragments as values of Boolean variables. When two or more wave-fragments collide they annihilate or merge into a new wave-fragment. States of the logic variables, represented by the wave-fragments, are changed in the result of the collision between the wave-fragments. Thus, a logical gate is implemented. Several theoretical designs and experimental laboratory implementations of Boolean logic gates have been proposed in the past but little has been done cascading the gates into binary arithmetical circuits. I propose a unique design of a binary one-bit full adder based on a fusion gate. A fusion gate is a two-input three-output logical device which calculates the conjunction of the input variables and the conjunction of one input variable with the negation of another input variable. The gate is made of three channels: two channels cross each other at an angle, a third channel starts at the junction. The channels contain a BZ medium. When two excitation wave-fragments, traveling towards each other along input channels, collide at the junction they merge into a single wave-front traveling along the third channel. If there is just one wave-front in the input channel, the front continues its propagation undisturbed. I make a one-bit full adder by cascading two fusion gates. I show how to cascade the adder blocks into a many-bit full adder.

The motivation for studying these MC systems is that they can realize the concept of constructive and destructive signal superposition, which leads to favorable properties such as inter-symbol interference (ISI) reduction and avoiding environmental contamination due to continuous release of molecules into the channel. This work first derives the maximum likelihood (ML) detector for a binary MC system with reactive signaling molecules under the assumption that the detector has perfect knowledge of the ISI. The performance of this genie-aided ML detector yields an upper bound on the performance of any practical detector. In addition, two suboptimal detectors of different complexity are proposed. The proposed ML detector as well as one of the suboptimal detectors require the channel response (CR) of the considered MC system. Moreover, the CR is needed for the performance evaluation of all proposed detectors. However, analyzing MC with reactive signaling is challenging since the underlying partial differential equations that describe the reaction-diffusion mechanism are coupled and non-linear. Therefore, an algorithm is developed in this paper for efficient computation of the CR to any arbitrary transmit symbol sequence. The accuracy of this algorithm is validated via particle-based simulation. Simulation results using the developed CR algorithm show that the performance of the proposed suboptimal detectors can approach that of the genie-aided ML detector. Moreover, these results show that MC systems with reactive signaling have superior performance relative to those with non-reactive signaling due to the reduction of ISI enabled by the chemical reactions.", "venue": "2018 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)", "authors": ["Vahid  Jamali", "Nariman  Farsad", "Robert  Schober", "Andrea J.

To provide comparable complexity while operating much faster and with manageable power dissipation, networks based on circuits combining complementary metal-oxide-semiconductors (CMOSs) and adjustable two-terminal resistive devices (memristors) have been developed. In such circuits, the usual CMOS stack is augmented with one or several crossbar layers, with memristors at each crosspoint. There have recently been notable improvements in the fabrication of such memristive crossbars and their integration with CMOS circuits, including first demonstrations of their vertical integration. Separately, discrete memristors have been used as artificial synapses in neuromorphic networks. Very recently, such experiments have been extended to crossbar arrays of phase-change memristive devices. The adjustment of such devices, however, requires an additional transistor at each crosspoint, and hence these devices are much harder to scale than metal-oxide memristors, whose nonlinear current\u2013voltage curves enable transistor-free operation. Here we report the experimental implementation of transistor-free metal-oxide memristor crossbars, with device variability sufficiently low to allow operation of integrated neural networks, in a simple network: a single-layer perceptron (an algorithm for linear classification). The network can be taught in situ using a coarse-grain variety of the delta rule algorithm to perform the perfect classification of 3 \u00d7 3-pixel black/white images into three classes (representing letters).

With the newer generations of the D-Wave annealer, more advanced features are available which allow the user to have greater control of the anneal process. In this contribution, we study how such features can help in improving the quality of the solutions returned by the annealer. Specifically, we focus on two of these features: reverse annealing and h-gain. Reverse annealing (RA) was designed to allow refining a known solution by backward annealing from a classical state representing the solution to a mid-anneal point where a transverse field is present, followed by an ordinary forward anneal, which is hoped to improve on the previous solution. The h-gain (HG) feature stands for time-dependent gain in Hamiltonian linear (h) biases and was originally developed to help study freezeout times and phase transitions in spin glasses. Here we apply HG to bias the quantum state in the beginning of the annealing process towards the known solution as in the RA case, but using a different apparatus. We also investigate a hybrid reverse annealing/h-gain schedule, which has a backward phase resembling an RA step and whose forward phase uses the HG idea. To optimize the parameters of the schedules, we employ a Bayesian optimization framework. We test all techniques on a variety of input problems including the weighted Maximum Cut problem and the weighted Maximum Clique problem.

These architectures are energy efficient and therefore, suitable for cognitive information processing on resource and power-constrained environments, ones where sensor and edge nodes of internet-of-things (IoT) operate. To map a spiking neural network (SNN) to a neuromorphic architecture, prior works have proposed design-time based solutions, where the SNN is first analyzed offline using representative data and then mapped to the hardware to optimize some objective functions such as minimizing spike communication or maximizing resource utilization. In many emerging applications, machine learning models may change based on the input using some online learning rules. In online learning, new connections may form or existing connections may disappear at run-time based on input excitation. Therefore, an already mapped SNN may need to be re-mapped to the neuromorphic hardware to ensure optimal performance. Unfortunately, due to the high computation time, design-time based approaches are not suitable for remapping a machine learning model at run-time after every learning epoch. In this paper, we propose a design methodology to partition and map the neurons and synapses of online learning SNN-based applications to neuromorphic architectures at run-time. Our design methodology operates in two steps \u2013 step 1 is a layer-wise greedy approach to partition SNNs into clusters of neurons and synapses incorporating the constraints of the neuromorphic architecture, and step 2 is a hill-climbing optimization algorithm that minimizes the total spikes communicated between clusters, improving energy consumption on the shared interconnect of the architecture. We conduct experiments to evaluate the feasibility of our algorithm using synthetic and realistic SNN-based applications.

The BZ LMs have solid--liquid interfaces in contrast to the previously reported BZ encapsulation systems used to study pattern formations and wave transfers, such as BZ emulsions and BZ vesicles. All these systems are important to study as they can be seen as analogues for information transfer in excitable systems in nature. Due to the powder coating of the LMs, LMs do not wet the underlying substrate, making the LMs mobile, enabling them to be easily arranged in arrays. The preparation of complex LMs, containing an acidic oscillating solution, proves the resilience of LMs and their application in transporting a wide range of chemical cargoes and in playing a mediating role in chemical reactions. PTFE-coated LMs were harder to prepare and not as robust as PE-coated LMs, therefore oscillation studies of BZ LMs positioned in arrays only focused on PE-coated LMs. Sporadic transfer of excitation waves was observed between LMs placed in close proximity to each other in ordered and disordered arrays, suggesting the transfer of liquid species possibly arises from contact between imperfectly coated areas at the LM--LM interface or capillary action, where solution is actively transported to the marble surface through the coating. Propagation pathways of the excitation waves in both the disordered and ordered arrays of BZ LMs are reported.

Magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) is a good candidate for constructing the NVFF thanks to its low power, high speed, good CMOS compatibility, etc. In this article, we propose a novel magnetic NVFF based on an emerging memory device called NAND-SPIN. The data writing of NAND-SPIN is achieved by successively applying two unidirectional currents, which respectively generate the spin orbit torque (SOT) and spin transfer torque (STT) for erase and programming operations. This characteristic allows us to design an erase-hidden and drivability-improved magnetic NVFF. Furthermore, more design flexibility could be obtained since the backup operation of the proposed NVFF is not limited by the inherent slave latch. Simulation results show that our proposed NVFF achieves performance improvement in terms of power, delay and area, compared with conventional slave-latch-driven SOT-NVFF designs.", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology", "authors": ["Ziyi  Wang", "Zhaohao  Wang", "Yansong  Xu", "Bi  Wu", "Weisheng  Zhao"], "year": 2020, "n_citations": 2}

However, current approaches to in-memory machine learning focus often on the implementation of models and algorithms which cannot be reconciled with the true, physical properties of resistive memory. Consequently, these properties, in particular cycle-to-cycle conductance variability, are considered as non-idealities that require mitigation. Here by contrast, we embrace these properties by selecting a more appropriate machine learning model and algorithm. We implement a Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling algorithm within a fabricated array of 16,384 devices, configured as a Bayesian machine learning model.

Suitably located transmitters are designed to release a continuous flow of drug molecules in the surrounding environment, where they diffuse and reach the target. These molecules are received when they chemically react with compliant receptors deployed on the receiver surface. In these conditions, if the release rate is relatively high and the drug absorption time is significant, congestion may happen, essentially at the receiver site. This phenomenon limits the drug absorption rate and makes the signal transmission ineffective, with an undesired diffusion of drug molecules elsewhere in the body. The original contribution of this paper consists of a theoretical analysis of the causes of congestion in diffusion-based molecular communications. For this purpose, it is proposed a reception model consisting of a set of pure loss queuing systems. The proposed model exhibits an excellent agreement with the results of a simulation campaign made by using the Biological and Nano-Scale communication simulator version 2 (BiNS2), a well-known simulator for molecular communications, whose reliability has been assessed through in vitro experiments.

Recognizing the very size of the brain's circuits, hyperdimensional (HD) computing can model neural activity patterns with points in a HD space, that is, with hypervectors as large randomly generated patterns. At its very core, HD computing is about manipulating and comparing these patterns inside memory. Emerging nanotechnologies such as carbon nanotube field effect transistors (CNFETs) and resistive RAM (RRAM), and their monolithic 3D integration offer opportunities for hardware implementations of HD computing through tight integration of logic and memory, energy-efficient computation, and unique device characteristics.

The fuse is stimulated by trains of identical pulses where successive pulse trains feature opposite polarities.

Selfconfiguration techniques can be employed to correct these imperfections, but not all techniques are equal. This paper highlights the importance of algorithmic stability in self-configuration. N\u00e4\u0131ve approaches based on sequentially setting matrix elements are unstable and perform poorly for large meshes, while techniques based on power ratios perform well in all cases, even in the presence of large errors. Based on this insight, we propose a self-configuration scheme for triangular meshes that requires only external detectors and works without prior knowledge of the component imperfections. This scheme extends to the rectangular mesh by adding a single array of detectors along the diagonal. 1 Research Laboratory of Electronics, MIT, 50 Vassar Street, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA 2 NTT Research Inc., Physics and Informatics Laboratories, 940 Stewart Drive, Sunnyvale, CA 94085, USA Photonic technologies increasingly rely on programmable and reconfigurable circuits. A central component in such circuits is the universal multiport interferometer: an optical device with N > 2 inputs and outputs, whose linear input-output relation (transfer matrix) is set by the user. Such interferometers are indispensable in applications ranging from linear optical quantum computing [1, 2] and RF photonics [3, 4] to signal processing [5, 6] and machine learning acceleration [7\u201310], and will play an important role in proposed photonic field-programmable gate arrays [5, 11]. Size (i.e. number of ports) is an important figure of merit for all of these applications, and scaling up multiport interferometers is an active field in research. Recent advances in silicon photonics are promising, allowing the scale-up from small proof-of-concept designs to large (and therefore technologically useful) systems [2, 12, 13]. Component imperfections are a major challenge to scaling the size of multiport interferometers. This is because all large devices are based on dense meshes of tunable beamsplitters, whose circuit depth grows with size. Most non-recirculating designs are variants of the triangular Reck [14] or rectangular Clements [15] beamsplitter mesh, both of which encode anN\u00d7N unitary transfer matrix into a compact mesh of programmable Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZIs). These circuits have O(N) depth, meaning that component errors cascade as light propagates down the mesh. The upshot is that scaling in size must be accompanied by scaling in precision to preserve the accuracy of the input-output map. This challenge is most acute for optical machine learning applications [7, 10], which rely on very large mesh sizes for performance [12, 13], where fabrication errors from even state-of-the-art technology are predicted to significantly degrade ONN accuracy in hardware [16]. Several self-configuration techniques can suppress the effect of component imprecisions. For machine learning applications, the MZI phase shifts can be learned by in situ training [17], but this requires extra hardware (inline power detectors [18]) and the learned weights are specific to the given device. Alternatively, if the chip has been pre-calibrated so the imperfections are known, global optimization can be used to find the phase shifts offline [19, 20]; however, this approach is time-consuming and requires that the hardware imperfections be known to high accuracy. MZI errors can also be eliminated by pairing MZIs, though this doubles the loss and chip area [21]. Finally, for triangular meshes, the MZIs of each diagonal can be configured sequentially [22\u201324]. This approach, however, also requires O(N) inline power detectors (or pre-calibrated MZIs that can be configured to a perfect \u201cbar\u201d or \u201ccross\u201d state). In short, all configuration schemes to date rely on either (i) additional hardware complexity, i.e. inline detectors or MZI pairing, or (ii) accurate pre-calibration of the mesh\u2019s component errors. In this article, we analyze self-configuration algorithms that require only external detectors and do not rely on prior calibration of the MZI mesh. Not all algorithms are created equal, and algorithmic stability distinguishes good algorithms from bad ones: for example, a straightforward approach based on sequentially matching matrix elements works in principle, but performs poorly in the presence of large errors. Based on this insight, we propose an algorithm based on orthogonality and power ratios that performs well in all cases, even in the presence of large errors. This scheme is directly applicable to triangular meshes, but can also be extended to a rectangular mesh with the addition of a single array of inline power detectors along the diagonal. This paper is organized as follows: In Sec. 1, we introduce the Reck and Clements meshes, analyze their statistical properties in the presence of errors, and derive analytic estimates for the improvements possible by selfconfiguration. Sec. 2 covers the theory of self-configuring algorithms and introduces our proposed methods in the context of the Reck scheme.

Finally, Sec. 4 extends our method to the rectangular Clements scheme by splitting the rectangle with a diagonal of internal monitors. 1 Statistics of Imperfect Meshes The most common multiport interferometer designs are the Reck triangle [14] and the Clements rectangle [15]. In both cases, the circuit can be laid out on a regular grid of 2\u00d7 2 elements (Fig. 1(a)) without any waveguide crossings, a major advantage compared to competing designs [25\u201328].

Quantum algorithms can be simulated in a pseudo quantum environment, but implementation involves realization of quantum circuits through physical synthesis of quantum gates. This requires decomposition of complex quantum gates into a cascade of simple one-qubit and two-qubit gates. The methodological framework for physical synthesis imposes a constraint regarding placement of operands (qubits) and operators. If physical qubits can be placed on a grid, where each node of the grid represents a qubit, then quantum gates can only be operated on adjacent qubits, otherwise SWAP gates must be inserted to convert nonlinear nearest neighbour architecture to linear nearest neighbour architecture. Insertion of SWAP gates should be made optimal to reduce cumulative cost of physical implementation. A schedule layout generation is required for placement and routing a priori to actual implementation. In this paper, two algorithms are proposed to optimize the number of SWAP gates in any arbitrary quantum circuit. The first algorithm is intended to start with generation of an interaction graph followed by finding the longest path starting from the node with maximum degree. The second algorithm optimizes the number of SWAP gates between any pair of non-neighbouring qubits.

Such an MPC problem is classified as a non-deterministic polynomial-time-hard combinatorial problem, and thus real-time sequential optimization is difficult to obtain with conventional computational systems.

The considered SFQ technology is superconducting digital electronic devices that operate at cryogenic temperatures with active circuit elements called the Josephson junction, which operate at high switching speeds and low switching energy - allowing SFQ circuits to operate at frequencies over 300 gigahertz. Due to key differences between SFQ and CMOS logic, verification techniques for the former are not as advanced as the latter. Thus, it is crucial to develop efficient verification techniques as the complexity of SFQ circuits scales. The VeriSFQ framework focuses on verifying the key circuit and gate-level properties of $\\mathrm{SFQ}$ logic: fanout, gate-level pipeline, path balancing, and input-to-output latency. The combinational circuits considered in analyzing the performance of VeriSFQ are: Kogge-Stone adders (KSA), array multipliers, integer dividers, and select ISCAS\u201985 combinational benchmark circuits.

This aims at building correct-by-construction quantum circuits to be deployed on quantum devices such as those available at the IBM Q Experience. Quantum circuit reversibility is ensured by minimal complements, extended recursively. Measurements are postponed to the end of such recursive computations, termed \"quantamorphisms\", thus maximising the quantum effect. Quantamorphisms are classical catamorphisms which, extended to ensure quantum reversibility, implement quantum cycles (vulg. for-loops) and quantum folds on lists. By Kleisli correspondence, quantamorphisms can be written as monadic functional programs with quantum parameters. This enables the use of Haskell, a monadic functional programming language, to perform the experimental work. Such calculated quantum programs prepared in Haskell are pushed through Quipper to the Qiskit interface to IBM Q quantum devices. The generated quantum circuits - often quite large - exhibit the predicted behaviour. However, running them on real quantum devices incurs into a significant amount of errors.

However, achieving high memory fidelity incurs significant write-energy costs, which should be reduced for large-scale deployment of MRAMs. In this paper, we formulate a biconvex optimization problem to optimize write fidelity given energy and latency constraints. The basic idea is to allocate non-uniform write pulses depending on the importance of each bit position. The fidelity measure we consider is mean squared error (MSE), for which we optimize write pulses via alternating convex search (ACS). By using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, we derive analytic solutions and propose an iterative water-filling-type algorithm by leveraging the analytic solutions. Hence, the proposed iterative water-filling algorithm is computationally more efficient than the original ACS while their solutions are identical. Although the original ACS and the proposed iterative water-filling algorithm do not guarantee global optimality, the MSEs obtained by the proposed algorithm are comparable to the MSEs by complicated global nonlinear programming solvers. Furthermore, we prove that the proposed algorithm can reduce the MSE exponentially with the number of bits per word. For an 8-bit accessed word, the proposed algorithm reduces the MSE by a factor of 21. We also evaluate the proposed algorithm for MNIST dataset classification supposing that the model parameters of deep neural networks are stored in MRAMs. The numerical results show that the optimized write pulses can achieve 40% write energy reduction for a given classification accuracy.

Contrastive-divergence (CD) specially optimized for OxRAM devices was used to drive the synaptic weight update mechanism of each layer in the network.

Many software approaches rely on heavy compiler optimization to squeeze extra value from noisy machines but are fundamentally limited by hardware. Alone, these software approaches help to maximize the use of available hardware but cannot overcome the inherent limitations posed by the underlying technology.An alternative approach is to explore the use of new, though potentially less developed, technology as a path towards scalability. In this work we evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of a Neutral Atom (NA) architecture. NA systems offer several promising advantages such as long range interactions and native multiqubit gates which reduce communication overhead, overall gate count, and depth for compiled programs. Long range interactions, however, impede parallelism with restriction zones surrounding interacting qubit pairs. We extend current compiler methods to maximize the benefit of these advantages and minimize the cost.Furthermore, atoms in an NA device have the possibility to randomly be lost over the course of program execution which is extremely detrimental to total program execution time as atom arrays are slow to load. When the compiled program is no longer compatible with the underlying topology, we need a fast and efficient coping mechanism.

In consequence, they operate much above CMOS-compatible voltages of 1.2 V and with high insertion losses. Furthermore, the state and information they carry are lost once the power is turned off \u2013 so, they are volatile. Thus, realizing modulators and phase shifters that overcome all of those problems still remain a challenge.

Furthermore, the deep structure and large model size will make DNNs prohibitive to embedded systems and IoT devices, where low power consumption are required. To address these challenges, spin orbit torque magnetic random-access memory (SOT-MRAM) and SOT-MRAM based Processing-In-Memory (PIM) engines have been used to reduce the power consumption of DNNs since SOT-MRAM has the characteristic of near-zero standby power, high density, none-volatile. However, the drawbacks of SOT-MRAM based PIM engines such as high writing latency and requiring low bit-width data decrease its popularity as a favorable energy efficient DNN accelerator. To mitigate these drawbacks, we propose an ultra energy efficient framework by using model compression techniques including weight pruning and quantization from the software level considering the architecture of SOT-MRAM PIM. And we incorporate the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) into the training phase to further guarantee the solution feasibility and satisfy SOT-MRAM hardware constraints. Thus, the footprint and power consumption of SOT-MRAM PIM can be reduced, while increasing the overall system throughput at the meantime, making our proposed ADMM-based SOT-MRAM PIM more energy efficiency and suitable for embedded systems or IoT devices. Our experimental results show the accuracy and compression rate of our proposed framework is consistently outperforming the reference works, while the efficiency (area \\& power) and throughput of SOT-MRAM PIM engine is significantly improved.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Geng  Yuan", "Xiaolong  Ma", "Sheng  Lin", "Zhengang  Li", "Caiwen  Ding"], "year": 2019, "n_citations": 3}

However, the latter is restricted in that only a fraction of all pairwise couplers between physical qubits exists. Modeling the connectivity structure of a given problem instance thus necessitates the computation of a minor embedding of the variables in the problem specification onto the logical qubits, which consist of several physical qubits \"chained\" together to act as a logical one. After annealing, it is however not guaranteed that all chained qubits get the same value (\u22121 or +1 for an Ising model, and 0 or 1 for a QUBO), and several approaches exist to assign a final value to each logical qubit (a process called \"unembedding\"). In this work, we present tailored unembedding techniques for four important NP-hard problems: the Maximum Clique, Maximum Cut, Minimum Vertex Cover, and Graph Partitioning problems. Our techniques are simple and yet make use of structural properties of the problem being solved. Using Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi random graphs as inputs, we compare our unembedding techniques to three popular ones (majority vote, random weighting, and minimize energy).

However, such 3D architectures within small form factor increase hotspots and demand careful consideration of thermal management at all levels of integration [4] as stacked transistors are detached from the substrate (i.e., heat sink). Traditional system level approaches such as liquid cooling [5], heat spreader [6], etc. are inadequate for transistor level 3-D integration and have huge cost overhead [7]. In this paper, we investigate the thermal profile for transistor level 3-D integration approaches through finite element based modeling. Additionally, we propose generic physical level heat management features for such transistor level 3-D integration and show their application through detailed thermal modeling and simulations. These features include a thermal junction and heat conducting nano pillar. The heat junction is a specialized junction to extract heat from a selected region in 3-D; it allows heat conduction without interference with the electrical activities of the circuit. In conjunction with the junction, our proposed thermal pillars enable heat dissipation through the substrate; these pillars are analogous to TSVs/Vias, but carry only heat. Such structures are generic and is applicable to any transistor level 3-D integration approaches. We perform 3-D finite element based analysis to capture both static and transient thermal behaviors of 3-D circuits, and show the effectiveness of heat management features.

However, carefully examining its detailed formulation reveals that the traditional identification of logically reversible computational operations with bijective transformations of the full digital state space is actually not the correct logical-level characterization of the full set of classical computational operations that can be carried out physically with asymptotically zero energy dissipation. To find the correct logical conditions for physical reversibility, we must account for initial-state probabilities when applying the Principle. The minimal logical-level requirement for the physical reversibility of deterministic computational operations is that the subset of initial states that exhibit nonzero probability in a given statistical operating context must be transformed one-to-one into final states. Thus, any computational operation is conditionally reversible relative to any sufficiently-restrictive precondition on its initial state, and the minimum dissipation required for any deterministic operation by Landauer's Principle asymptotically approaches 0 when the probability of meeting any preselected one of its suitable preconditions approaches 1. This realization facilitates simpler designs for asymptotically thermodynamically reversible computational hardware, compared to designs that are restricted to using only fully-bijective operations such as Toffoli type operations. Thus, this more general framework for reversible computing provides a more effective theoretical foundation to use for the design of practical reversible computers than does the more restrictive traditional model of reversible logic.

Depending on the mediated pulse amplitude, the memristive device switched to the low resistance state after a few cycles and a frequency adaptation and phase locking were observed.

This disparity between concern and behaviour is known as the Privacy Paradox. Such issues are particularly prevalent on wearable devices. These products can store personal data, such as text messages and contact details. However, owners rarely use protective features. Educational games can be effective in encouraging changes in behaviour. Therefore, we developed the first privacy game for (Android) Wear OS watches. 10 participants used smartwatches for two months, allowing their high-level settings to be monitored. Five individuals were randomly assigned to our treatment group, and they played a dynamically-customised privacy-themed game. To minimise confounding variables, the other five received the same app but lacking the privacy topic. The treatment group improved their protection, with their usage of screen locks significantly increasing (p\u202f=\u202f0.043). In contrast, 80% of the control group continued to never restrict their settings. After the posttest phase, we evaluated behavioural rationale through semi-structured interviews. Privacy concerns became more nuanced in the treatment group, with opinions aligning with behaviour. Actions appeared influenced primarily by three factors: convenience, privacy salience and data sensitivity.

Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) devices, such as Phase Change Memory and Spin-Transfer Torque RAM, are suitable candidates for main memory to reduce energy consumption. But unlike DRAM, NVMs access latencies are higher than DRAM and NVM writes are more energy sensitive than DRAM write operations. Thus, Hybrid Main Memory Systems (HMMS) employing DRAM and NVM have been proposed to reduce the overall energy depletion of main memory while optimizing the performance of NVM. This paper proposes eMap, an optimal heap memory object placement planner in HMMS. eMap considers the object-level access patterns and energy consumption at the application level and provides an ideal placement strategy for each object to augment performance and energy utilization. eMap is equipped with two modules, eMPlan and eMDyn. Specifically, eMPlan is a static placement planner which provides one time placement policies for memory object to meet the energy budget while eMDyn is a runtime placement planner to consider the change in energy limiting constraint during the runtime and shuffles the memory objects by taking into account the access patterns as well as the migration cost in terms of energy and performance. The evaluation shows that our proposed solution satisfies both the energy limiting constraint and the performance. We compare our methodology with the state-of-the-art memory object classification and allocation (MOCA) framework. Our extensive evaluation shows that our proposed solution, eMPlan meets the energy constraint with 4.17 times less costly and reducing the energy consumption up to 14% with the same performance. eMDyn also satisfies the performance and energy requirement while considering the migration cost in terms of time and energy.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Taeuk  Kim", "Safdar  Jamil", "Joongeon  Park", "Youngjae  Kim"], "year": 2020, "n_citations": 0}

These computers only support operations decomposed into one- and two-qubit gates and only two-qubit gates between physically connected pairs of qubits.

We propose a new compiler structure, Orchestrated Trios, that first decomposes to the three-qubit Toffoli, routes the inputs of the higher-level Toffoli operations to groups of nearby qubits, then finishes decomposition to hardware-supported gates. This significantly reduces communication overhead by giving the routing pass access to the higher-level structure of the circuit instead of discarding it. A second benefit is the ability to now select an architecture-tuned Toffoli decomposition such as the 8-CNOT Toffoli for the specific hardware qubits now known after the routing pass. We perform real experiments on IBM Johannesburg showing an average 35% decrease in two-qubit gate count and 23% increase in success rate of a single Toffoli over Qiskit.

However, real life quantum systems are open and are highly sensitive to errors. Hence error correction is of utmost importance if quantum computation is to be carried out in reality.

Moreover, the error correction blocks themselves may induce errors as the gates used for error correction may be noisy. In this paper, we have proposed a procedure to trace error probability due to noisy gates and decoherence in quantum circuit and place an error correcting block only when the error probability exceeds a certain threshold. This procedure shows a drastic reduction in the required number of error correcting blocks. Furthermore, we have considered concatenated codes with tile structure layout lattice architecture[25][21],[24] and SWAP gate based qubit transport mechanism.

Machine learning (kernel classification) has become ubiquitous as the forefront method for pattern recognition and has been shown to have numerous societal applications. While not yet fault-tolerant, Quantum computing is an entirely new method of computation due to its exploitation of quantum phenomena such as superposition and entanglement. While current machine learning classifiers like the Support Vector Machine are seeing gradual improvements in performance, there are still severe limitations on the efficiency and scalability of such algorithms due to a limited feature space which makes the kernel functions computationally expensive to estimate. By integrating quantum circuits into traditional ML, we may solve this problem through the use of quantum feature space, a technique that improves existing Machine Learning algorithms through the use of parallelization and the reduction of the storage space from exponential to linear. This research expands on this concept of the Hilbert space and applies it for classical machine learning by implementing the quantum-enhanced version of the K nearest neighbors algorithm. This paper first understands the mathematical intuition for the implementation of quantum feature space and successfully simulates quantum properties and algorithms like Fidelity and Grover's Algorithm via the Qiskit python library and the IBM Quantum Experience platform.

HBC uses the human body as the communication channel between on-body devices. Previous studies characterizing the human body channel has reported widely varying channel response much of which has been attributed to the variation in measurement setup. This calls for the development of a unifying bio-physical model of HBC, supported by in-depth analysis and an understanding of the effect of excitation, termination modality on HBC measurements. This paper characterizes the human body channel up to 1\u00a0MHz frequency to evaluate it as a medium for the broadband communication. The communication occurs primarily in the electro-quasistatic (EQS) regime at these frequencies through the subcutaneous tissues. A lumped bio-physical model of HBC is developed, supported by experimental validations that provide insight into some of the key discrepancies found in previous studies. Voltage loss measurements are carried out both with an oscilloscope and a miniaturized wearable prototype to capture the effects of non-common ground. Results show that the channel loss is strongly dependent on the termination impedance at the receiver end, with up to 4\u00a0dB variation in average loss for different termination in an oscilloscope and an additional 9 dB channel loss with wearable prototype compared to an oscilloscope measurement. The measured channel response with capacitive termination reduces low-frequency loss and allows flat-band transfer function down to 13\u00a0KHz, establishing the human body as a broadband communication channel. Analysis of the measured results and the simulation model shows that instruments with 50 \u2126 input impedance (Vector Network Analyzer, Spectrum Analyzer) provides pessimistic estimation of channel loss at low frequencies. Instead, high impedance and capacitive termination should be used at the receiver end for accurate voltage mode loss measurements of the HBC channel at low frequencies.

This implies that there exists a 3D tile set at temperature $$2$$2 in the 2HAM which is intrinsically universal for the class of all 2D $$\\hbox {STAM}^+$$STAM+ systems at temperature $$1$$1. Moreover, we also show that there exists an $$\\hbox {STAM}^+$$STAM+ tile set for temperature $$\\tau $$\u03c4 which is intrinsically universal for the class of all 2D $$\\hbox {STAM}^+$$STAM+ systems at temperature $$\\tau $$\u03c4, including the case where $$\\tau = 1$$\u03c4=1. To achieve these results, we also demonstrate useful techniques and transformations for converting an arbitrarily complex $$\\hbox {STAM}^+$$STAM+ tile set into an $$\\hbox {STAM}^+$$STAM+ tile set where every tile has a constant, low amount of complexity, in terms of the number and types of \u201csignals\u201d they can send, with a trade off in scale factor. While the first result is of more theoretical interest, showing the power of static tiles to simulate dynamic tiles when given one extra plane in 3D, the second result is of more practical interest for the experimental implementation of STAM tiles, since it provides potentially useful strategies for developing powerful STAM systems while keeping the complexity of individual tiles low, thus making them easier to physically implement.", "venue": "Natural Computing", "authors": ["Tyler  Fochtman", "Jacob  Hendricks", "Jennifer E.

However, a key missing step in this mapping is to formally prove that the dynamics of such a nonlinear dynamical system is toward minimizing a global cost function which is equivalent with the spin model Hamiltonian. Here, we introduce a minimal dynamical model for a network of dissipatively coupled optical oscillators and prove that the dynamics of such a system is governed by a Lyapunov function that serves as a cost function for the system. This cost function is in general a function of both phases and intensities of the oscillators and depends strongly on the pump parameter. In case of bipartite network topologies, the amplitudes of the oscillators become identical in the steady state and the cost function reduces to the XY Hamiltonian. In the general case for non-trivial network topologies, however, the cost function approaches the XY Hamiltonian only in the strong pump limit. We show that by adiabatically tuning the pump parameter, the network can largely avoid trapping into the local minima of the governing cost function and stabilize into the ground state of the associated XY Hamiltonian.

On the other hand, terahertz (THz) enabled intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is expected to be one of the core enabling technologies for forthcoming beyond-5G wireless communications that promise a broad range of data-demand applications. In this paper, we propose a UAV-mounted IRS (UIRS) communication system over THz bands for confidential data dissemination from an access point (AP) towards multiple ground user equipments (UEs) in IoT networks. Specifically, the AP intends to send data to the scheduled UE, while unscheduled UEs may behave as potential adversaries. To protect information messages and the privacy of the scheduled UE, we aim to devise an energy-efficient multi-UAV covert communication scheme, where the UIRS is for reliable data transmissions, and an extra UAV is utilized as a cooperative jammer generating artificial noise (AN) to degrade unscheduled UEs detection, improving communication covertness.This poses a novel max-min optimization problem in terms of minimum average energy efficiency (mAEE), targetting to improve covert throughput and reduce UAVs' propulsion energy consumption subject to some practical constraints such as covertness which is determined analytically. Since the optimization problem is non-convex, we tackle it via the block successive convex approximation (BSCA) approach to iteratively solve a sequence of approximated convex sub-problems, designing the binary user scheduling, AP's power allocation, maximum AN jamming power, IRS beamforming, and both UAVs' trajectory and velocity planning. Finally, we present a low-complex overall algorithm for system performance enhancement with complexity and convergence analysis.

These networks are vital for many aspects of a cell, including intra-cellular transport. It has been suggested by others that this network could be responsible for sub-cellular information processing, which naturally raises the question of whether such a system could be exploited for more artificial constructs. In this endeavour, this paper studies the electrical properties of Taxol-stabilised MT ensembles.\n\n\nEXPERIMENTS\nElectrical experiments were conducted on samples containing MTs. Measurements were made using iridium-coated needle electrodes on a droplet. Cyclic voltammetry was performed, by sweeping through a DC voltage range of [-1.2,+1.2] V. AC measurements were also taken, between 1 kHZ and 10\u202fMHz, and with a DC bias. Separately, pulse train stimulation were conducted, with an amplitude of 0.5\u202fV and duration of 1\u202fms.\n\n\nFINDINGS\nCyclic voltammetry experiments reveal that the MT droplets act as electrical switches, under the experimental conditions. This is partly revealed in a substantial hysteresis. The stimulation of a MT droplet with a positive fast-impulse resulted in oscillation of the droplet's resistance, not observed in control experiments. Taxol-stabilised MT samples proved to be mem-resistive/mem-inductive, therefore the history of their electrical characterisation is able to change their response and behaviour. If the history of electrical stimuli is the same, so is the response.

Here we consider the question whether one graph (source) state can be transformed into another graph (target) state, using a specific set of quantum operations (LC+LPM+CC): single-qubit Clifford operations (LC), single-qubit Pauli measurements (LPM) and classical communication (CC) between sites holding the individual qubits. We first show that deciding whether a graph state |G> can be transformed into another graph state |G'> using LC+LPM+CC is NP-Complete, even if |G'> is restricted to be the GHZ-state. However, we also provide efficient algorithms for two situations of practical interest: \n1. |G> has Schmidt-rank width one and |G'> is a GHZ-state. The Schmidt-rank width is an entanglement measure of quantum states, meaning this algorithm is efficient if the original state has little entanglement. Our algorithm has runtime O(|V(G')||V(G)|^3), and is also efficient in practice even on small instances as further showcased by a freely available software implementation. \n2. |G> is in a certain class of states with unbounded Schmidt-rank width, and |G'> is a GHZ-state of a constant size. Here the runtime is O(poly(|V(G)|)), showing that more efficient algorithms can in principle be found even for states holding a large amount of entanglement, as long as the output state has constant size. \nOur results make use of the insight that deciding whether a graph state |G> can be transformed to another graph state |G'> is equivalent to a known decision problem in graph theory, namely the problem of deciding whether a graph G' is a vertex-minor of a graph G.

The challenge we face is that capacitors are inherently non-linear energy accumulators, which leads to significant variations in the charging rates. We solve this problem by jointly configuring the parameters of the capacitor and the associated energy harvesting circuits, which allows us to operate in the charging cycles that are approximately linear.

To reduce program instruction counts and improve application expressivity, vendors have proposed, and shown proof-of-concept demonstrations of richer instruction sets such as XY gates (Rigetti) and fSim gates (Google). These instruction sets comprise of families of 2Q gate types parameterized by continuous qubit rotation angles. That is, it allows a large set of different physical operations to be realized on the qubits, based on the input angles. However, having such a large number of gate types is problematic because each gate type has to be calibrated periodically, across the full system, to obtain high fidelity implementations. This results in substantial recurring calibration overheads even on current systems which use only a few gate types. Our work aims to navigate this tradeoff between application expressivity and calibration overhead, and identify what instructions vendors should implement to get the best expressivity with acceptable calibration time.Studying this tradeoff is challenging because of the diversity in QC application requirements, the need to optimize applications for widely different hardware gate types and noise variations across gate types. Therefore, our work develops NuOp, a flexible compilation pass based on numerical optimization, to efficiently decompose application operations into arbitrary hardware gate types. Using NuOp and four important quantum applications, we study the instruction set proposals of Rigetti and Google, with realistic noise simulations and a calibration model. Our experiments show that implementing 4-8 types of 2Q gates is sufficient to attain nearly the same expressivity as a full continuous gate family, while reducing the calibration overhead by two orders of magnitude.

However, the replenishment of signaling molecules at the TX is challenging in practice. Furthermore, in most envisioned MC applications, e.g., in the medical field, it is not desirable to insert the TX into the MC system, as this might impair natural biological processes. In this paper, we propose the concept of media modulation based MC where the TX is placed outside the channel and utilizes signaling molecules already existing inside the system. We consider signaling molecules that can be in different states which can be switched by external stimuli. Hence, in media modulation based MC, for information transmission, the TX stimulates the signaling molecules to encode information into their state. In particular, we elaborate media modulation for the group of photochromic molecules, which undergo lightinduced reversible transformations, and study the usage of these molecules for information transmission in a three-dimensional duct system. We develop a statistical model for the received signal which depends on the distribution of the signaling molecules in the system, the reliability of the state control mechanism, and the randomness of molecule propagation. Furthermore, we analyze the performance of media modulation based MC in terms of the bit error rate (BER).

The general mechanism can be summarised as when a stimulated neuron is itself excited and also suppresses the activity of its local neighbours via inhibitory connections. The effect is to generate an increase in contrast between spatial environmental stimuli. Simple organisms, such as the single-celled slime mould Physarum polycephalum possess no neural tissue yet, despite this, are known to exhibit complex computational behaviour. Could simple organisms such as slime mould approximate LI without recourse to neural tissue? We describe a model whereby LI can emerge without explicit inhibitory wiring, using only bulk transport effects.We use a multi-agent model of slime mould to reproduce the characteristic edge contrast amplification effects of LI using excitation via attractant based stimuli. We also explore a counterpart behaviour, Lateral Activation (where stimulated regions are inhibited and lateral regions are excited), using simulated exposure to light irradiation. In both cases restoration of baseline activity occurs when the stimuli are removed. In addition to the enhancement of local edge contrast the long-term change in population density distribution corresponds to a collective response to the global brightness of 2D image stimuli, including the scalloped intensity profile of the Chevreul staircase and the perceived difference of two identically bright patches in the Simultaneous Brightness Contrast (SBC) effect. This simple model approximatesLI contrast enhancement phenomena and global brightness perception in collective unorganised systems without fixed neural architectures. This may encourage further research into unorganised analogues of neural processes in simple organisms and suggests novel mechanisms to generate collective perception of contrast and brightness in distributed computing and robotic devices.", "venue": "Computational Intelligence, Medicine and Biology - Selected Links", "authors": ["Jeff  Jones"], "year": 2015, "n_citations": 9}

Communication via molecular diffusion is a popular strategy that is ubiquitous in nature and very fast over distances on the order of a micron or less. Existing closed-form analysis of the diffusion channel impulse response generally assumes that the transmitter is a point source. In this paper, channel impulse responses are derived for spherical transmitters with either a passive or absorbing receiver. The derived channel impulse responses are in closed-form for a one-dimensional environment and can be found via numerical integration for a three-dimensional environment. The point transmitter assumption (PTA) is formally defined so that its accuracy can be measured in comparison to the derived spherical transmitter impulse responses. The spherical transmitter model is much more accurate than the PTA when the distance between a transmitter and its receiver is small relative to the size of the transmitter.

The utility function of a classical exploratory stochastic Knowledge Seeking Agent, KL-KSA, is generalized to distance measures from quantum information theory on density matrices. Quantum process tomography (QPT) algorithms form the tractable subset of programs for modeling environmental dynamics. The optimal QPT policy is selected based on a mutable cost function based on algorithmic complexity as well as computational resource complexity. Instead of Turing machines, we estimate the cost metrics on a high-level language to allow realistic experimentation. The entire agent design is encapsulated in a self-replicating quine which mutates the cost function based on the predictive value of the optimal policy choosing scheme. Thus, multiple agents with pareto-optimal QPT policies evolve using genetic programming, mimicking the development of physical theories each with different resource trade-offs. This formal framework is termed Quantum Knowledge Seeking Agent (QKSA). A proof-of-concept is implemented and available as an open-sourced software. Despite its importance, few quantum reinforcement learning models exist in contrast to the current thrust in quantum machine learning. QKSA is the first proposal for a framework that resembles the classical URL models. Similar to how AIXI-tl is a resource-bounded active version of Solomonoff universal induction, QKSA is a resource-bounded participatory observer framework to the recently proposed algorithmic information-based reconstruction of quantum mechanics. Besides its theoretical impact, QKSA can be applied for simulating and studying aspects of quantum information theory like control automation, multiple observers, course-graining, distance measures, resource complexity trade-offs, etc. Specifically, we demonstrate that it can be used to accelerate quantum variational algorithms which include tomographic reconstruction as its integral subroutine.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Aritra  Sarkar", "Zaid  Al-Ars", "Harshitta  Gandhi", "Koen  Bertels"], "year": 2021, "n_citations": 0}

As such, CNNs require fast runtime (forward propagation) to process high-resolution visual streams in real time. This is still a challenging task even with state-of-the-art graphics and tensor processing units. The bottleneck in computational efficiency primarily occurs in the convolutional layers. Performing operations in the Fourier domain is a promising way to accelerate forward propagation since it transforms convolutions into elementwise multiplications, which are considerably faster to compute for large kernels. Furthermore, such computation could be implemented using an optical 4f system with orders of magnitude faster operation. However, a major challenge in using this spectral approach, as well as in an optical implementation of CNNs, is the inclusion of a nonlinearity between each convolutional layer, without which CNN performance drops dramatically. Here, we propose a Spectral CNN Linear Counterpart (SCLC) network architecture and develop a Knowledge Distillation (KD) approach to circumvent the need for a nonlinearity and successfully train such networks. While the KD approach is known in machine learning as an effective process for network pruning, we adapt the approach to transfer the knowledge from a nonlinear network (teacher) to a linear counterpart (student). We show that the KD approach can achieve performance that easily surpasses the standard linear version of a CNN and could approach the performance of the nonlinear network. Our simulations show that the possibility of increasing the resolution of the input image allows our proposed 4f optical linear network to perform more efficiently than a nonlinear network with the same accuracy on two fundamental image processing tasks: (i) object classification and (ii) semantic segmentation.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Jinlin  Xiang", "Shane  Colburn", "Arka  Majumdar", "Eli  Shlizerman"], "year": 2021, "n_citations": 0}

In this paper, we introduce a novel polymorphic circuit design approach where deterministic interference between nano-metal lines is leveraged for logic computing and configuration.

In this paper, we investigate diffusion-based spherical matrix-type drug carriers, which are employed in medical applications. In a matrix carrier, the drug molecules are dispersed in the matrix core and diffuse from the inner to the outer layers of the carrier once immersed in a dissolution medium. We derive the channel response of the matrix carrier transmitter for an absorbing receiver. The results are validated by particle-based simulations and compared with commonly used point and transparent spherical transmitters to highlight the necessity of considering practical models.

Moreover, lately it has been shown that superconducting qubits are extremely susceptible to external sources of faults, such as ionizing radiation. When adopted in large scale, radiation-induced errors are expected to become a serious challenge for qubits reliability.

In addition, power dissipation is the main limitation of all the nanoelectronics design techniques including the QCA. Researchers have proposed various mechanisms to solve this problem. Among them, reversible computing is considered as a reliable solution to reduce the power dissipation. On the other hand, adders are fundamental circuits for most digital systems. So, in this paper, the focus is on designing of reversible full-adders in logical and layout levels. For this aim, the first, a method for converting irreversible functions to reversible ones is investigated. Based on it, two novel designs of reversible full-adders/subtractors are presented. In another section, a new five-input majority gate is introduced. By using of this gate, a new reversible full-adder is designed. Finally, the proposed structures are extended to design three new 8-bit reversible full-adder/subtractors. The results are indicative of the outperformance of the proposed designs in comparison with the best available ones in terms of area, complexity, delay, reversible/irreversible layout, and also in logic level in terms of garbage outputs, control inputs, number of majority and NOT gates.\nGraphical abstract", "venue": "The European Physical Journal D", "authors": ["Moein  Sarvaghad-Moghaddam", "Ali A.

The overall system performance are dominated by interconnect rather than device. As such, it is imperative to accurately measure and model interconnect parasitic in order to predict interconnect performance on silicon. Despite many test structures developed in the past to characterize device models and layout effects, only few of them are available for interconnects. Nevertheless, they are either not suitable for real chip implementation or too complicated to be embedded. A compact yet comprehensive test structure to capture all interconnect parasitic in a real chip is needed. To address this problem, this paper describes a set of test structures that can be used to study the timing performance (i.e. propagation delay and crosstalk) of various interconnect configurations. Moreover, an empirical model is developed to estimate the actual RC parasitic. Compared with the state-of-the-art interconnect test structures, the new structure is compact in size and can be easily embedded on die as a parasitic variation monitor.

Laflamme showed that 5 qubits are necessary to correct a single error on a qubit. In a Pauli error model, four different types of errors can occur on a qubit. Maximally entangled states are orthogonal to each other and hence can be uniquely distinguished by a measurement in the Bell basis. Thus a measurement in Bell basis and a unitary transformation is sufficient to correct error in Bell states. However, such a measurement is not possible for non-maximally entangled states. In this work we show that the 16 possible errors for a non-maximally entangled two qubit system map to only 8 distinct error states. Hence, it is possible to correct the error without perfect knowledge of the type of error. Furthermore, we show that the possible errors can be grouped in such a way that all 4 errors can occur on one qubit, whereas only bit flip error can occur on the second qubit. As a consequence, instead of 10, only 8 qubits are sufficient to correct a single error. We propose an 8-qubit error correcting code to correct a single error in a non-maximally entangled state. We further argue that for an $n$-qubit non-maximally entangled state of the form $a|0>^{n} + b|1>^{n}$, it is always possible to correct a single error with fewer than $5n$ qubits, in fact only $3n+2$ qubits suffice.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Ritajit  Majumdar", "Susmita  Sur-Kolay"], "year": 2017, "n_citations": 0}

It was commonly believed that the relative phase deviations would prevent the relative phase Toffolis from being very helpful in practical large-scale designs. \nIn this paper, we report three circuit identities that provide the means for replacing certain configurations of the multiple control Toffoli gates with their simpler relative phase implementations, up to a selectable unitary on certain qubits, and without changing the overall functionality.

The d.c. action of the memristor is a current spike which imparts a short-term memory to the device. Here it is demonstrated that this short-term memory works exactly like habituation (e.g. in \\emph{Aplysia}). We elucidate the physical rules, based on energy conservation, governing the interaction of these current spikes: summation, `bounce-back', directionality and `diminishing returns'. Using these rules, we introduce 4 different logical systems to implement sequential logic in the memristor and demonstrate how sequential logic works by instantiating a NOT gate, an AND gate, an XOR gate and a Full Adder with a single memristor. The Full Adder makes use of the memristor's short-term memory to add together three binary values and outputs the sum, the carry digit and even the order they were input in. A memristor full adder also outputs the arithmetical sum of bits, allowing for a logically (but not physically) reversible system. Essentially, we can replace an input/output port with an extra time-step, allowing a single memristor to do a hither-to unexpectedly large amount of computation. This makes up for the memristor's slow operation speed and may relate to how neurons do a similarly-large computation with such slow operations speeds.

With emergence of memristors in VLSI technologies the idea of designing scalable analog data storage elements finds its second wind. A memristor, known for its history dependent resistance levels, independently can provide blocks of binary or discrete state data storage. However, using single memristor to save the analog value is practically limited due to the device variability and implementation complexity. In this paper, we present a new design of discrete state memory cell consisting of sub-cells constructed from a memristor and its resistive network. A memristor in the sub-cells provides the storage element, while its resistive network is used for programming its resistance. Several sub-cells are then connected in parallel, resembling potential divider configuration. The output of the memory cell is the voltage resulting from distributing the input voltage among the sub-cells. Here, proposed design was programmed to obtain 10 and 27 different output levels depending on the configuration of the combined resistive networks within the sub-cell. Despite the simplicity of the circuit, this realization of multilevel memory provides increased number of output levels compared to previous designs of memory technologies based on memristors.

This is insufficient to address routing requirements in high-density 3D ICs and even causes severe routing congestion at large-scale designs, limiting their benefits and scalability. Skybridge is a recently proposed fine-grained 3D IC fabric relying on vertical nanowires that presents a paradigm shift for scaling, while addressing associated 3D connectivity and manufacturability challenges. Skybridge's core fabric components enable a new 3D IC design approach with vertically-composed logic gates, and provide a greater degree of routing flexibility compared to conventional 2D and 3D ICs leading to much larger benefits and future scalability.

Therefore, this paper we propose a vertical channel model which nano-machines communicate with each other in the vertical direction based on pure diffusion. We first propose a vertical molecular communication model, we mainly considered the gravity as the factor, though the channel model is also affected by other main factors, such as the flow of the medium, the distance between the transmitter and the receiver, the delay or sensitivity of the transmitter and the receiver. Secondly, we set up a test-bed for this vertical channel model, in order to verify the difference between the theory result and the experiment data.

Namely, we work within the 2-Handed Assembly Model (2HAM), which is a model of self-assembly in which assemblies are formed by square tiles that are allowed to combine, using glues along their edges, individually or as pairs of arbitrarily large assemblies in a hierarchical manner, and we explore the abilities of these systems to simulate each other when the simulating systems have a higher \"temperature\" parameter, which is a system wide threshold dictating how many glue bonds must be formed between two assemblies to allow them to combine. It has previously been shown that systems with lower temperatures cannot simulate arbitrary systems with higher temperatures, and also that systems at some higher temperatures can simulate those at particular lower temperatures, creating an infinite set of infinite hierarchies of 2HAM systems with strictly increasing simulation power within each hierarchy. These previous results relied on two different definitions of simulation, one (strong simulation) seemingly more restrictive than the other (standard simulation), but which have previously not been proven to be distinct. Here we prove distinctions between them by first fully characterizing the set of pairs of temperatures such that the high temperature systems are intrinsically universal for the lower temperature systems (i.e. one tile set at the higher temperature can simulate any at the lower) using strong simulation. This includes the first impossibility result for simulation downward in temperature. We then show that lower temperature systems which cannot be simulated by higher temperature systems using the strong definition, can in fact be simulated using the standard definition, proving the distinction between the types of simulation.", "venue": "Fundam.

The very presence of the voltage and current state variables, associated by their electrodynamics sense with electrical and magnetic fields, in the resistive characteristic v = f(i), forces any resister to accumulate some magnetic and electrostatic fields and energies around itself, i.e. L and C elements are always present. From the circuit-theoretic point of view, the role of the memristor is seen, first of all, in the elimination of the use of a unique v(i). This makes circuits with hysteresis characteristics relevant, and also suggests that the concept of memristor should influence the basic problem of definition of nonlinearity. Since the memristor mainly originates from the resistor, it was found necessary to overview some unusual cases of resistive circuits.

To extend DNN's superior inference capabilities to energy constrained devices, architectures and circuits that minimize energy-per-MAC must be developed. In this respect, analog delay-based MAC is advantageous due to reasons both extrinsic and intrinsic to the MAC implementation - (1) lower fixed-point precision requirement for a DNN's evaluation, (2) better dynamic range than charge-based accumulation, for smaller technology nodes, and (3) simpler analog-digital interfacing. Implementing DNNs using delay-based MAC requires mixed-signal delay multipliers that accept digitally stored weights and analog voltages as arguments. To this end, a novel, linearly tune-able delay-cell is proposed, wherein, the delay is realized using an inverted MOS capacitor's (C*) steady discharge from a linearly input-voltage dependent initial charge. The cell is analytically modeled, constraints for its functional validity are determined, and jitter-models are developed. Multiple cells with scaled delays, corresponding to each bit of the digital argument, must be cascaded to form the multiplier. To realize such bit-wise delay-scaling of the cells, a biasing circuit is proposed that generates sub-threshold gate-voltages to scale C*'s discharging rate, and thus area-expensive transistor width-scaling is avoided. For 130nm CMOS technology, the theoretical constraints and limits on jitter are used to find the optimal design-point and quantify the jitter versus bits-per-multiplier trade-off.

Although this interpretation suggests high error tolerance, it is unclear which permutations are feasible, and how to produce a DNA string whose profile vector induces a given permutation. In this paper, by observing some necessary conditions, an upper bound for the number of feasible permutations is given. Further, a technique for deciding the feasibility of a permutation is devised.

The probabilistic absorber is an absorber which absorbs molecules upon collision with probability  ${q}$ . With random walk analysis, the discrete probability function of particle location in the presence of a probabilistic absorber can be found. Then, a continuous probability function is fitted to this Markov-based results with introducing several fitting parameters to the known probability function of particle location in an unbounded environment without an absorbing barrier. With this approach, a single receptor is modeled as an M/M/1/1 queue in which  ${q}$  represents the complementary blocking probability and the mean service time is the mean trafficking time. Therefore, we are able to model the stochastic nature of ligand-receptor binding, which comes from the incapability of a receptor to receive all molecules in its space; and also known as receptor occupancy. The proper consideration of the absorption effect leads to the accurate calculation of the concentration at the desired site, which is definitely less than the concentration obtained when neglecting it.

This is because NVM devices require high voltages and currents to access their synaptic weights, which further accelerate the circuit aging in neuromorphic hardware. Current methods for qualifying reliability are overly conservative, since they estimate circuit aging considering worst-case operating conditions and unnecessarily constrain performance. This paper proposes RENEU, a reliability-oriented approach to map machine learning applications to neuromorphic hardware, with the aim of improving system-wide reliability, without compromising key performance metrics such as execution time of these applications on the hardware. Fundamental to RENEU is a novel formulation of the aging of CMOS-based circuits in a neuromorphic hardware considering different failure mechanisms. Using this formulation, RENEU develops a system- wide reliability model which can be used inside a design-space exploration framework involving the mapping of neurons and synapses to the hardware. To this end, RENEU uses an instance of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to generate mappings that are Pareto-optimal in terms of performance and reliability. We evaluate RENEU using different machine learning applications on a state-of-the-art neuromorphic hardware with NVM synapses. Our results demonstrate an average 38% reduction in circuit aging, leading to an average 18% improvement in the lifetime of the hardware compared to current practices.

Capacitively driven wire has recently been shown to be effective in improving the performance of global interconnects. Such techniques can reduce the signal swing in the interconnect by using a capacitive divider network and does not require an additional voltage supply. However, the large reduction in signal swing makes it necessary to use differential signaling and amplification for successful regeneration at the receiver, which add area and static power. ME effect induced magnetization reversal has recently been proposed which shows the possibility of using a low voltage to switch a nanomagnet adjacent to a multi-ferroic oxide. Here, we propose an ME effect based receiver that uses the low voltage at the receiving end of the global wire to switch a nanomagnet. The nanomagnet is also used as the free layer of a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ), the resistance of which is tuned through the ME effect. This change in MTJ resistance is converted to full swing binary signals by using simple digital components. This process allows capacitive low swing interconnection without differential signaling or amplification, which leads to significant energy efficiency.

Solutions of many hard problems have been reported by numerically integrating the ODEs of DMMs, showing substantial advantages over state-of-the-art solvers. To investigate the reasons behind the robustness and effectiveness of this method, we employ three explicit integration schemes (forward Euler, trapezoid, and Runge-Kutta fourth order) with a constant time step to solve 3-SAT instances with planted solutions. We show that (i) even if most of the trajectories in the phase space are destroyed by numerical noise, the solution can still be achieved; (ii) the forward Euler method, although having the largest numerical error, solves the instances in the least amount of function evaluations; and (iii) when increasing the integration time step, the system undergoes a \"solvable-unsolvable transition\" at a critical threshold, which needs to decay at most as a power law with the problem size, to control the numerical errors. To explain these results, we model the dynamical behavior of DMMs as directed percolation of the state trajectory in the phase space in the presence of noise.

Such a CRN is robust in the sense that it is correct whether its evolution is governed by the standard model of mass-action kinetics, alternatives such as Hill-function or Michaelis-Menten kinetics, or other arbitrary models of chemistry that respect the (fundamentally digital) stoichiometric constraints (what are the reactants and products?). We develop a formal definition of such computation using a novel notion of reachability, and prove that a function is computable in this manner if and only if it is continuous piecewise linear.", "venue": "ITCS", "authors": ["Ho-Lin  Chen", "David  Doty", "David  Soloveichik"], "year": 2014, "n_citations": 52}

A 1T-1R synapse, adding a transistor (1T) in series with the memristive synapse (1R), has been proposed to mitigate such non-idealities. We observe that the non-linear characteristics of the transistor affect the overall conductance of the 1T-1R cell which in turn affects the Matrix-Vector-Multiplication (MVM) operation in crossbars. This 1T-1R non-ideality arising from the input voltage-dependent non-linearity is not only difficult to model or formulate, but also causes a drastic performance degradation of DNNs when mapped onto crossbars. In this paper, we analyse the non-linearity of the 1T-1R crossbar and propose a novel Non-linearity Aware Training (NEAT) method to address the non-idealities. Specifically, we first identify the range of network weights, which can be mapped into the 1T-1R cell within the linear operating region of the transistor. Thereafter, we regularize the weights of the DNNs to exist within the linear operating range by using iterative training algorithm. Our iterative training significantly recovers the classification accuracy drop caused by the non-linearity. Moreover, we find that each layer has a different weight distribution and in turn requires different gate voltage of transistor to guarantee linear operation. Based on this observation, we achieve energy efficiency while preserving classification accuracy by applying heterogeneous gate voltage control to the 1T-1R cells across different layers. Finally, we conduct various experiments on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 benchmark datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our non-linearity aware training.

The design and implementation of synthetic MC systems (MCSs) at nano- and microscale is very challenging. This is particularly true for synthetic MCSs employing biological components as transmitters and receivers or as interfaces with natural biological MCSs. Nevertheless, since such biological components have been optimized by nature over billions of years, using them in synthetic MCSs is highly promising. This paper provides a survey of biological components that can potentially serve as the main building blocks, i.e., transmitter, receiver, and signaling particles, for the design and implementation of synthetic MCSs. Nature uses a large variety of signaling particles of different sizes and with vastly different properties for communication among biological entities. Here, we focus on three important classes of signaling particles: cations (specifically protons and calcium ions), neurotransmitters (specifically acetylcholine, dopamine, and serotonin), and phosphopeptides. These three classes have unique and distinct features such as their large diffusion coefficients, their specificity, and/or their uniqueness of signaling that make them suitable candidates for signaling particles in synthetic MCSs. For each of these candidate signaling particles, we present several specific transmitter and receiver structures mainly built upon proteins that are capable of performing the distinct physiological functionalities required from the transmitters and receivers of MCSs. Moreover, we present options for both microscale implementation of MCSs as well as the micro-to-macroscale interfaces needed for experimental evaluation of MCSs. One of the main advantages of employing proteins for signal emission and detection is that they can be modified with tools from synthetic biology and be tailored to a wide range of application needs.

Modern neromorphic hardware integrates small-sized crossbars with time-multiplexed interconnects. Partitioning SNNs becomes essential in order to map them on neuromorphic hardware with the major aim to reduce the global communication latency and energy overhead.

Since such faults cannot be fully prevented, systems have to cope with their effects. At the same time there is the trend of multi-core processors in embedded systems. Approaches to achieve fault tolerance by using the multiple cores to establish redundancy have been presented in literature. However, typically only homogeneous redundancy techniques are considered to tolerate soft errors.

This decision-making strategy completely avoids decision conflicts while ensuring equality. However, decision conflicts can sometimes be beneficial if they yield greater rewards than non-conflicting decisions, indicating that greedy actions may provide positive effects depending on the given environment.

We show that an optimal mixture of entangled- and correlated-photon-based strategies exists depending on the dynamics of the reward environment as well as the difficulty of the given problem.

We formulate a linear optimization method of conductance in synaptic devices to reduce the average deviation of weight changes in synaptic devices from the weight changes calculated by the Stochastic Gradient Rule (SGD) algorithm. To this end, we introduce a metric called Update Noise (UN) to analyze the update noise dynamics during the training process.

The optimized network in terms of UN under the conditional reverse update scheme achieved >90% accuracy on MNIST dataset under highly nonlinear LTP and LTD conditions while using inaccurate and infrequent conductance sensing. Furthermore, HNN trained with the proposed method showed better accuracy compared to previously reported nonlinear weight update mitigation techniques under the same hardware specifications and device conditions.

Therefore, a novel finite horizon adaptive optimal distributed power allocation (FH-AODPA) scheme is proposed by incorporating the effect of channel uncertainties for enhanced CRN in the presence of wireless channel uncertainties under two cases. In Case 1, proposed scheme can force the Signal-to-interference (SIR)of the SUs to converge to a higher target value for increasing network throughput when PU\u2019s are not communicating within finite horizon. Once PUs are activated as in the Case 2, proposed scheme cannot only force the SIR\u2019s of PUs to converge to a higher target SIR, but also force the SIR\u2019s of SUs to converge to a lower value for regulating their interference to Pus during finite time period. In order to mitigate the attenuation of SIR\u2019s due to channel uncertainties the proposed novel FH-AODPA allows the SIR\u2019s of both PUs\u2019 and SUs\u2019 to converge to a desired target SIR while minimizing the energy consumption within finite horizon.

A completely different paradigm is based on three-terminal stochastic units which could be called \u201cp-bits\u201d, where the output is a random telegraphic signal continuously fluctuating between 0 and 1 with a tunable mean. p-bits can be interconnected to receive weighted contributions from others in a network, and these weighted contributions can be chosen to not only solve problems of optimization and inference but also to implement precise Boolean functions in an inverted mode. This inverted operation of Boolean gates is particularly striking: They provide inputs consistent to a given output along with unique outputs to a given set of inputs. The existing demonstrations of accurate invertible logic are intriguing, but will these striking properties observed in computer simulations carry over to hardware implementations? This paper uses individual micro controllers to emulate p-bits, and we present results for a 4-bit ripple carry adder with 48 p-bits and a 4-bit multiplier with 46 p-bits working in inverted mode as a factorizer.

However, there are limitations and challenges with the current technologies. Firstly, the stimulation of neurons currently is possible through implantable electrodes but limited to a population of neurons. Secondly, a major hurdle lies in developing miniature devices that can last for a lifetime in the patient's brain. In parallel, Optogenetics has emerged proposing the stimulation of neurons using light by means of optical fibers inserted through the skull. Many challenges are thus introduced in terms of suitability to patient's lifestyle and biocompatibility. We have recently proposed the concept of wireless optogenetic nanonetworking devices (WiOptND), addressing these long-term deployment problems, and at the same time targeting single neuron stimulation [1]. The WiOptND is equipped with a miniature LED that is able to stimulate a genetically engineered neuron while harvesting energy from ultrasonic vibrations. This paper investigates how light propagates in the brain tissue, and based on the power required to emit sufficient intensity for stimulation, an energy harvesting circuitry is designed. A number of charging protocols are also proposed to maximize energy efficiency while ensuring minimum number of neural spike misfirings. These protocols include the Charge and Fire, the Predictive Sliding Detection Window, and its variant Markov-Chain based Time-Delay Patterns. Simulation results show the drop of stimulation ratio for 25% and more stable trend in its efficiency ratio are exhibited on Markov-Chain based Time-Delay Patterns compared to Change and Fire.

ISI mainly occurs because of the slow and highly random propagation of the messenger molecules, which causes the emitted molecules from the previous symbols to interfere with molecules from the current symbol. An effective way to mitigate the ISI is using enzymes to degrade undesired molecules. Prior work on ISI mitigation by enzymes has assumed an infinite amount of enzymes randomly distributed around the molecular channel. Taking a different approach, this paper assumes an MCvD channel with a limited amount of enzymes. The main question this paper addresses is how to deploy these enzymes in an effective structure so that ISI mitigation is maximized. To find an effective MCvD channel environment, this study considers optimization of the shape of the transmitter node, the deployment location and structure, the size of the enzyme deployed area, and the half-lives of the enzymes. It also analyzes the dependence of the optimum size of the enzyme area on the distance and half-life.

In addition to mapping quantum gates into the supported gate set, it is necessary to map pseudo qubits in the technology-independent circuit into physical qubits of the technology-dependent circuit such that coupling constraints among qubits acting in multiple-qubit gates are satisfied. It is usually not possible to find such a mapping without adding SWAP gates into the circuit. To cope with the technical limitations of NISQ-era quantum devices, it is advantageous to find a mapping that requires as few additional gates as possible. The large search space of possible mappings makes this task a difficult combinatorial optimization problem. In this work, we demonstrate how zero-suppressed decision diagrams (ZDDs) can be used for typical implementation tasks in quantum mapping algorithms. We show how to maximally partition a quantum circuit into blocks of adjacent gates, and if adjacent gates within a circuit do not share common mapping permutations, we attempt to combine them using parallelized SWAP operations represented in a ZDD.

The paper will give an overview of the neuromorphic computing platform at the Kirchhoff-Institute for Physics and the associated hardware requirements which drove the described technological developments. In the first phase of the project standard redistribution technologies from wafer level packaging were adapted to enable a high density reticle-to-reticle routing on 200 mm CMOS wafers. Neighboring reticles were interconnected across the scribe lines with an 8 \u03bcm pitch routing based on semi-additive copper metallization which was photo defined by full field mask aligning equipment. Passivation by photo sensitive benzocyclobutene (BCB) was used to enable a second intra-reticle routing layer. Final IO pads of nickel with flash gold were generated on top of each reticle. For final electrical connection the wafers were placed into mechanical fixtures and the IOs of all reticles were touched by elastomeric connectors. With that concept neuromorphic systems based on full wafers could be assembled and tested. The fabricated high density inter-reticle routing revealed a very high yield of larger than 99.9 %. In order to allow an upscaling of the system size to a large number of wafers with feasible effort a full wafer embedding concept for printed circuit boards was developed and proven in the second phase of the project. The wafers were thinned to 250 \u03bcm and laminated with additional prepreg layers and copper foils into a core material. A 200 mm circular cut was done into the core material and the inner prepreg layers to create the required clearance for the wafer. After lamination of the PCB panel the reticle IOs of the embedded wafer were accessed by micro via drilling, copper electroplating, lithography and subtractive etching of the PCB wiring structure. The created wiring with 50 \u03bcm line width enabled an access of the reticle IOs on the embedded wafer as well as a board level routing. The panels with the embedded wafers were subsequently stressed with up to 1000 thermal cycles between 0 \u00b0C and 100 \u00b0C and have shown no severe failure formation over the cycle time.", "venue": "2017 IEEE 19th Electronics Packaging Technology Conference (EPTC)", "authors": ["Kai  Zoschke", "Maurice  G\u00fcttler", "Lars  B\u00f6ttcher", "Andreas  Gr\u00fcbl", "Dan Husmann de Oliveira", "Johannes  Schemmel", "Karlheinz  Meier", "Oswin  Ehrmann"], "year": 2017, "n_citations": 4}

To characterize the energy availability associated with specific human activities (e.g., relaxing, walking, cycling), we analyze a motion dataset with over 40 participants. Based on acceleration measurements that we collected for over 200 hours, we study energy generation processes associated with day-long human routines. We also briefly summarize our experiments with moving objects. We develop energy allocation algorithms that take into account practical IoT node design considerations, and evaluate the algorithms using the collected measurements.

Despite the long history of the Principle, its fundamental rationale and proper interpretation remain frequently misunderstood. Contrary to some misinterpretations of the Principle, the mere transfer of entropy between computational and non-computational subsystems can occur in a thermodynamically reversible way without increasing total entropy. However, Landauer's Principle is not about general entropy transfers; rather, it more specifically concerns the ejection of (all or part of) some correlated information from a controlled, digital form (e.g., a computed bit) to an uncontrolled, non-computational form, i.e., as part of a thermal environment. Any uncontrolled thermal system will, by definition, continually re-randomize the physical information in its thermal state, from our perspective as observers who cannot predict the exact dynamical evolution of the microstates of such environments. Thus, any correlations involving information that is ejected into and subsequently thermalized by the environment will be lost from our perspective, resulting directly in an irreversible increase in total entropy. Avoiding the ejection and thermalization of correlated computational information motivates the reversible computing paradigm, although the requirements for computations to be thermodynamically reversible are less restrictive than frequently described, particularly in the case of stochastic computational operations. There are interesting possibilities for the design of computational processes that utilize stochastic, many-to-one computational operations while nevertheless avoiding net entropy increase that remain to be fully explored.", "venue": "RC", "authors": ["Michael P.

In contrast to the existing techniques, the proposed scheme employs a homogeneous molecular communication for bidirectional relaying where all the nodes (i.e., end nodes and relay node) are allowed to operate on the same type of molecule instead of utilizing different types of molecule for different nodes. As a result, this proposal of homogeneous molecular relaying remarkably improves the resource reuse capability.

Within this highly generalized model we provide three new solutions to tile self-assembly problems that have been addressed within the abstract Tile Assembly Model and its variants, showing that signal passing tiles allow for substantial improvement across multiple complexity metrics. Our first result utilizes a recursive assembly process to achieve tile-type efficient assembly of linear structures, using provably fewer tile types than what is possible in standard tile assembly models.

In this work, we propose two designs for quantum integer division. The designs are based on quantum Clifford+T gates and are optimized for T-count and T-depth. Quantum circuits that are based on Clifford+T gates can be made fault tolerant in nature but the T gate is very costly to implement. As a result, reducing T-count and T-depth have become important optimization goals. Existing quantum hardware is limited in terms of number of available qubits. Thus, ancillary qubits are a circuit overhead that needs to be kept to a minimum. We propose two quantum integer division circuits. The first quantum integer division circuit is based on the non-restoring division algorithm. The proposed non-restoring division circuit is optimized for total quantum hardware (T-count and T-depth) cost but requires 2* n + 1 ancillary qubits. We also propose a quantum integer division circuit based on the restoring division algorithm. The proposed restoring division circuit is optimized for total qubits. The design requires only n ancillary qubits but will need more quantum hardware than the non-restoring division circuit. Both proposed quantum circuits are based on (i) a new quantum conditional addition circuit, (ii) a new quantum adder-subtractor and (iii) a new quantum subtraction circuit.

This holds in particular for AI methods that solve sequence processing tasks, a primary application target for spike-based neuromorphic hardware. One difficulty is that DNNs for such tasks typically employ Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units. Yet an efficient emulation of these units in spike-based hardware has been missing. We present a biologically inspired solution that solves this problem. This solution enables us to implement a major class of DNNs for sequence processing tasks such as time series classification and question answering with substantial energy savings on neuromorphic hardware. In fact, the Relational Network for reasoning about relations between objects that we use for question answering is the first example of a large DNN that carries out a sequence processing task with substantial energy-saving on neuromorphic hardware. Energy consumption is a major impediment for more wide-spread applications of new AI-methods that use DNNs, especially in edge devices. Spike-based neuromorphic hardware is one direction that promises to alleviate this problem. This research direction is partially motivated by the method that brains use to run even more complex and larger neural networks than those DNNs that are used in current AI, with a total energy consumption of just 20W: Neurons in the brain only rarely emit spikes which mostly triggers energy consumption in neurons and synapses. But it has remained an open problem as to how DNNs that are needed for modern AI solutions could be implemented in neuromorphic hardware in such a sparse firing mode. Another open problem is how the LSTM units of such DNNs, that are needed for providing a working memory for sequence processing tasks, could be implemented in spike-based neuromorphic hardware. We present a biologically inspired solution to the second problem, that simultaneously provides a step towards also solving the first problem, since it reduces the firing activity of neurons that hold working memory content. We combine this method with a brain-inspired technique called membrane voltage regularization for enforcing sparse firing activity during the training of the DNN. We have tested the impact of these two innovations on computational performance and energy consumption for two benchmark tasks in an implementation on a representative spike-based chip: Intel\u2019s neuromorphic research chip Loihi [Davies et al., 2018]. We find significant reductions in the energy-delay product (EDP). In contrast to power, EDP accounts for the true energy and time cost per task/workload/computation. Simultaneously, these implementations demonstrate that two hallmarks of cognitive computations, both in brains and in machine intelligence, working memory and reasoning about relations between concepts or objects, can in fact be implemented more efficiently in spike-based neuromorphic hardware than in GPUs, the standard computing hardware for implementing DNNs. Implementing a long short-term memory in spike-based neuromorphic hardware Working memory is maintained in an LSTM unit in a special memory cell, to which readand write-access is gated by trained neurons with sigmoidal activation function [Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997]. Such an LSTM unit is difficult to realize efficiently in spike-based hardware. However, it turns out that by simply adding a standard feature of some biological neurons, slow after-hyperpolarizing (AHP) currents, a spiking neural network (SNN) acquires similar working memory capabilities as LSTM units over the time scale of the AHP currents. These AHP currents lower the membrane potential of a neuron after each of its spikes (see Fig. 1). Furthermore, these AHP currents can easily be implemented on Loihi with the desirable side benefit of reducing firing activity, and therefore ar X iv :2 10 7. 03 99 2v 1 [ cs .N E ] 8 J ul 2 02 1", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Philipp  Plank", "Arjun  Rao", "Andreas  Wild", "Wolfgang  Maass"], "year": 2021, "n_citations": 1}

The other two are asynchronous and are based on modulating information on the relative time between two consecutive releases of information particles using indistinguishable or distinguishable particles. All modulation schemes result in a system that relate the transmitted and the received signals through an additive noise, which follows a stable distribution. As the common notion of the variance of a signal is not suitable for defining the power of stable distributed signals (due to infinite variance), we derive an expression for the geometric power of a large class of stable distributions, and then use this result to characterize the geometric signal-to-noise ratio (G-SNR) for each of the modulation techniques. In addition, for binary communication, we derive the optimal detection rules for each modulation technique. Numerical evaluations indicate that the bit error rate (BER) is constant for a given G-SNR, and the performance gain obtained by using synchronized communication is significant.

Our kinetic model makes relatively weak assumptions, which implies that energy barriers predicted by our model would exist in a wide variety of systems and conditions.

The quality of spectrum sensing is evaluated by both sensing accuracy and sensing efficiency. Here, sensing accuracy is represented by the false-alarm probability and the detection probability, whereas sensing efficiency is represented by the sensing overhead and network throughput. In this paper, we propose a group-based cooperative medium access control (MAC) protocol called GC-MAC, which addresses the tradeoff between sensing accuracy and efficiency. In GC-MAC, the cooperative SUs are grouped into several teams. During a sensing period, each team senses a different channel while SUs in the same team perform the joint detection on the targeted channel. The sensing process will not stop unless an available channel is discovered. To reduce the sensing overhead, an SU-selecting algorithm is presented to choose selectively the cooperative SUs based on the channel dynamics and usage patterns. Then, an analytical model is built to study the sensing accuracy-efficiency tradeoff under two types of channel conditions: a time-invariant channel and a time-varying channel. An optimization problem that maximizes achievable throughput is formulated to optimize the important design parameters. Both saturation and nonsaturation situations are investigated with respect to throughput and sensing overhead.

PIRM leverages this transverse reading to directly provide bulk-bitwise logic of multiple adjacent operands in the nanowire, simultaneously.

The state-of-the-art base-callers adopt deep neural networks (DNNs) to translate electrical signals generated by nanopore sequencers to digital DNA symbols. A DNN-based base-caller consumes 44.5% of total execution time of a nanopore sequencing pipeline. However, it is difficult to quantize a base-caller and build a power-efficient processing-in-memory (PIM) to run the quantized base-caller. Although conventional network quantization techniques reduce the computing overhead of a base-caller by replacing floating-point multiply-accumulations by cheaper fixed-point operations, it significantly increases the number of systematic errors that cannot be corrected by read votes. The power density of prior nonvolatile memory (NVM)-based PIMs has already exceeded memory thermal tolerance even with active heat sinks, because their power efficiency is severely limited by analog-to-digital converters (ADC). Finally, Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) decoding and read voting cost 53.7% of total execution time in a quantized base-caller, and thus became its new bottleneck. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm/architecture co-designed PIM, Helix, to power-efficiently and accurately accelerate nanopore base-calling.

Existing metamaterials are specifically designed for a single application working under preset conditions (e.g., electromagnetic cloaking for a fixed angle of incidence) and cannot be reused. Software-defined metamaterials (SDMs) are a much sought-after paradigm shift, exhibiting electromagnetic properties that can be reconfigured at runtime using a set of software primitives. To enable this new technology, SDMs require the integration of a network of controllers within the structure of the metamaterial, where each controller interacts locally and communicates globally to obtain the programmed behavior. The design approach for such controllers and the interconnection network, however, remains unclear due to the unique combination of constraints and requirements of the scenario. To bridge this gap, this paper aims to provide a context analysis from the computation and communication perspectives.

A quantum-walk-based algorithm that is standing out in the literature is the lackadaisical quantum walk. The lackadaisical quantum walk is an algorithm developed to search two-dimensional grids whose vertices have a self-loop of weight l. In this paper, we address several issues related to the application of the lackadaisical quantum walk to successfully search for multiple solutions on grids. Firstly, we show that only one of the two stopping conditions found in the literature is suitable for simulations. We also demonstrate that the final success probability depends on the space density of solutions and the relative distance between solutions. Furthermore, this work generalizes the lackadaisical quantum walk to search for multiple solutions on grids of arbitrary dimensions. In addition, we propose an optimal adjustment of the self-loop weight l for such scenarios of arbitrary dimensions. It turns out the other fits of l found in the literature are particular cases.

However, applications may have critical and non-critical data interleaved with smaller granularity. For example, a data structure for graph nodes can have pointers (critical) to neighboring nodes and its score (non-critical, depending on the use-case). This data structure cannot be directly mapped to approximate memory due to the gap between the approximation granularity and the granularity of data criticality. We refer to this issue as the granularity gap problem. In this paper, we first show that many applications potentially suffer from this problem. Then we propose a framework to quantitatively evaluate the performance overhead of a possible method to avoid this problem using known techniques.The evaluation results show that the performance overhead is non-negligible compared to expected benefit from approximate memory,suggesting that the granularity gap problem is a significant concern.", "venue": "ICPE", "authors": ["Soramichi  Akiyama", "Ryota  Shioya"], "year": 2021, "n_citations": 0}

Here we lay the foundations of a new design paradigm that fuses analogue and digital thinking by combining digital electronics with memristive devices for achieving charge-based computation; information processing where every dissipated charge counts. This is realised by introducing memristive devices into standard logic gates, thus rendering them reconfigurable and able to perform analogue computation at a power cost close to digital.

Nevertheless, their impact on TCP performance has been overlooked, which is observed that the said TCP performance collapse occurs owing to the significant difference in signal quality between LOS and NLOS links. We propose a novel TCP design for mmWave communications, a mmWave performance enhancing proxy (mmPEP), enabling not only to overcome TCP performance collapse but also exploit the properties of mmWave channels. The base station installs the TCP proxy to operate the two functionalities called Ack management and batch retransmission. Specifically, the proxy sends the said early-Ack to the server not to decrease its sending rate even in the NLOS status. In addition, when a packet-loss is detected, the proxy retransmits not only lost packets but also the certain number of the following packets expected to be lost too. It is verified by ns-3 simulation that compared with benchmark, mmPEP enhances the end-to-end rate and packet delivery ratio by maintaining high sending rate with decreasing the loss recovery time.", "venue": "2017 IEEE 28th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)", "authors": ["Minho  Kim", "Seung-Woo  Ko", "Seong-Lyun  Kim"], "year": 2017, "n_citations": 8}

This poses a severe challenge to the engineer designing the corresponding microfluidic networks. In today\u2019s design processes, the engineer relies on calculations, assumptions, simplifications, as well as his/her experiences and intuitions. To validate the obtained specification of the microfluidic network, usually a prototype is fabricated and physical experiments are conducted thus far. In case the design does not implement the desired functionality, this prototyping iteration is repeated\u2014obviously resulting in an expensive and time-consuming design process. To avoid unnecessary debugging loops involving fabrication and testing, simulation methods could help to initially validate the specification of the microfluidic network before any prototype is fabricated. However, state-of-the-art simulation tools come with severe limitations, which prevent their utilization for practically relevant applications. More precisely, they are often not dedicated to droplet microfluidics, cannot handle the required physical phenomena, are not publicly available, and can hardly be extended. In this work, we present an advanced simulation approach for droplet microfluidics that addresses these shortcomings and, eventually, allows simulating practically relevant applications. To this end, we propose a simulation framework at the one-dimensional analysis model, which directly works on the specification of the design, supports essential physical phenomena, is publicly available, and is easy to extend. Evaluations and case studies demonstrate the benefits of the proposed simulator: While current state-of-the-art tools were not applicable for practically relevant microfluidic networks, the proposed simulator allows reducing the design time and costs, e.g., of a drug screening device from one person month and USD 1200, respectively, to just a fraction of that.", "venue": "ACM J.

Physarum networks also exhibit computationally desirable measures of transport efficiency in terms of overall path length, minimal connectivity and network resilience. Although significant progress has been made in mathematically modelling the behaviour of Physarum networks (and other biological transport networks) based on observed features in experimental settings, their initial emergence - and in particular their long-term persistence and evolution - is still poorly understood. We present a low-level, bottom-up, approach to the modelling of emergent transport networks. A population of simple particle-like agents coupled with paracrine chemotaxis behaviours in a dissipative environment results in the spontaneous emergence of persistent, complex structures. Second order emergent behaviours, in the form of network surface minimisation, are also observed contributing to the long term evolution and dynamics of the networks. The framework is extended to allow data presentation and the population is used to perform a direct (spatial) approximation of network minimisation problems. Three methods are employed, loosely relating to behaviours of Physarum under different environmental conditions.

We extend previous work by introducing two new problem variations that incorporate important characteristics identified by the quantum computing community. We apply temporal planning and CP to the baseline and extended QCC problems as both stand-alone and hybrid approaches. Our hybrid methods use solutions found by temporal planning to warm start CP, leveraging the ability of the former to find satisficing solutions to problems with a high degree of task optionality, an area that CP typically struggles with. The CP model, benefiting from inferred bounds on planning horizon length and task counts provided by the warm start, is then used to find higher quality solutions.

A number of reversible gates have been proposed by different researchers and various combinational circuits based on reversible gates have been developed. However the realization of sequential circuit in reversible logic is still at premature stage. Sequential circuits were not available because of feedback was not allowed in reversible circuit. However allowing feedback in space (not in time), some sequential reversible gates and circuits have been reported in the literature. In this dissertation, we have addressed the problem from two sides. One side is to propose a low cost reversible gate suitable for sequential building block i.e. T flip-flop and hence designing low cost synchronous and asynchronous counters. Another side is to generate the circuit from its behavioral description described in FSM form. Our propose designs of reversible counters are significantly better in optimization parameters such as gate counts, garbage outputs and constant inputs available in literature. We have also proposed a procedure for obtaining reversible circuit from behavioral description through FSM. A very few attempts have been reported in the literature for the conversion FSM to reversible FSM.Because of non-availability of generated sequential reversible circuit in literature, our results cannot be compared with any other circuits.

MASTISK is an open-source versatile and flexible tool developed in MATLAB for design exploration of dedicated neuromorphic hardware using nanodevices and hybrid CMOS-nanodevice circuits. MASTISK has a hierarchical organization capturing details at the level of devices, circuits (i.e. neurons or activation functions, synapses or weights) and architectures (i.e. topology, learning-rules, algorithms). In the current version, MASTISK provides user-friendly interface for design and simulation of spiking neural networks (SNN) powered by spatio-temporal learning rules such as Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP). Users may provide network definition as a simple input parameter file and the framework is capable of performing automated learning/inference simulations. Validation case-studies of the proposed open source simulator will be published in the proceedings of IJCNN 2018. The proposed framework offers new functionalities, compared to similar simulation tools in literature, such as: (i) arbitrary synaptic circuit modeling capability with both identical and non-identical stimuli, (ii) arbitrary spike modeling, and (iii) nanodevice based neuron emulation.

A new problem arises concerning the orchestration of a set of tiles towards serving end-to-end communication objectives. Towards that end, we propose a novel intelligent surface networking algorithm based on interpretable neural networks.

However, most of the recent literature has neglected the electron transfer mechanism occurring among living cells, and its role in cell-cell communication. Each cell relies on a continuous flow of electrons from its electron donor to its electron acceptor through the electron transport chain to produce energy in the form of the molecule adenosine triphosphate, and to sustain the cell's vital operations and functions. While the importance of biological electron transfer is well-known for individual cells, the past decade has also brought about remarkable discoveries of multi-cellular microbial communities that transfer electrons between cells and across centimeter length scales, e.g., biofilms and multi-cellular bacterial cables. These experimental observations open up new frontiers in the design of electron-based communications networks in microbial communities, which may coexist with the more well-known communication strategies based on molecular diffusion, while benefiting from a much shorter communication delay. This paper develops a stochastic model that links the electron transfer mechanism to the energetic state of the cell.

We further investigate the spectral efficiency (SE) improvement in the cellular downlink, and the effect of D2D transmissions on the cellular uplink. For mmWave links, we derive the coverage probability using dominant interferer analysis while accounting for both blockages and beamforming gains. For microwave D2D links, we derive the coverage probability considering both line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation. Numerical results show that downlink coverage and SE can be improved using two-hop D2D relaying. Specifically, microwave D2D relays achieve better coverage because D2D connections can be established under NLOS conditions. However, mmWave D2D relays achieve better coverage when the density of interferers is large because blockages eliminate interference from NLOS interferers.

However, the recent trend to design Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for achieving human-like cognitive abilities poses significant challenges towards the scalable design of neuromorphic systems (due to the increase in computation/storage demands). Network pruning [7] is a powerful technique to remove redundant connections for designing optimally connected (maximally sparse) DNNs. However, such pruning techniques induce irregular connections that are incoherent to the crossbar structure. Eventually they produce DNNs with highly inefficient hardware realizations (in terms of area and energy). In this work, we propose TraNNsformer \u2014 an integrated training framework that transforms DNNs to enable their efficient realization on MCA-based systems. TraNNsformer first prunes the connectivity matrix while forming clusters with the remaining connections. Subsequently, it retrains the network to fine tune the connections and reinforce the clusters. This is done iteratively to transform the original connectivity into an optimally pruned and maximally clustered mapping.

The proposed C-LUT offers an attractive alternative for implementing combinational logic as well as sequential logic versus previous spin-based LUT designs in the literature. Foremost, C-LUT eliminates the sense amplifier typically employed by using a differential polarity dual MTJ design, as opposed to a static reference resistance MTJ. This realizes a much wider read margin and the Monte Carlo simulation of the proposed fracturable C-LUT indicates no read and write errors in the presence of a variety of process variations scenarios involving MOS transistors as well as MTJs. Additionally, simulation results indicate that the proposed C-LUT reduces the standby power dissipation by 5.4-fold compared to the SRAM-based LUT.

We first show that there is the similarity between the dynamics of memristors and neurons. That is, some kind of flux-controlled memristors can not respond to the sinusoidal voltage source quickly, namely, they can not switch `on' rapidly. Furthermore, these memristors have refractory period after switch `on', which means that it can not respond to further sinusoidal inputs until the flux is decreased. We next show that the memristor-coupled two-cell CNN can exhibit chaotic behavior. In this system, the memristors switch `off' and `on' at irregular intervals, and the two cells are connected when either or both of the memristors switches `on'. We then propose the modified CNN model, which can hold a binary output image, even if all cells are disconnected and no signal is supplied to the cell after a certain point of time. However, the modified CNN requires power to maintain the output image, that is, it is volatile. We next propose a new memristor CNN model. It can also hold a binary output state (image), even if all cells are disconnected, and no signal is supplied to the cell, by memristor's switching behavior. Furthermore, even if we turn off the power of the system during the computation, it can resume from the previous average output state, since the memristor CNN has functions of both short-term (volatile) memory and long-term (non-volatile) memory. The above suspend and resume feature are useful when we want to save the current state, and continue work later from the previous state. Finally, we show that the memristor CNN can exhibit interesting two-dimensional waves, if an inductor is connected to each memristor CNN cell.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Makoto  Itoh"], "year": 2019, "n_citations": 2}

As a result, the dynamics of such oscillator networks evolve naturally to local minima of the Lyapunov function. Two simple additional steps (i.e., adding noise, and turning subharmonic locking on and off smoothly) enable the network to find excellent solutions of Ising problems. We demonstrate our method on Ising versions of the MAX-CUT and graph colouring problems, showing that it improves on previously published results on several problems in the G benchmark set.

Recently, Echo State Networks and Liquid State Machines have been proposed as possible RNN alternatives, under the name of Reservoir Computing (RC). RCs are far more easy to train.

Many classical search methods have been developed in order to tackle this problem. However, the availability of quantum computing architectures has given us the opportunity to address this problem with new (quantum) techniques. This paper describes a quantum isomer search procedure for determining all the structural isomers of alkanes. We first formulate the structural isomer search problem as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem. The QUBO formulation is for general use on either annealing or gate-based quantum computers. We use the D-Wave quantum annealer to enumerate all structural isomers of all alkanes with fewer carbon atoms (n < 10) than Decane (C10H22). The number of isomer solutions increases with the number of carbon atoms. We find that the sampling time needed to identify all solutions scales linearly with the number of carbon atoms in the alkane. We probe the problem further by employing reverse annealing as well as a perturbed QUBO Hamiltonian and find that the combination of these two methods significantly reduces the number of samples required to find all isomers.", "venue": "PloS one", "authors": ["Jason P.

Severe lithography and material limitations seen below the 20 nm node, however, are challenging the fundamental premise of affordable CMOS scaling. Just continuing to co-optimize leaf cell circuit and layout designs with process technology does not enable us to exploit the challenges of a sub-20 nm CMOS. For affordable scaling it is imperative to work past sub-20 nm technology impediments while exploiting its features. To this end, we propose to broaden the scope of design technology co-optimization (DTCO) to be more holistic by including micro-architecture design and CAD, along with circuits, layout and process technology. Applying such holistic DTCO to the most significant block in a system-on-chip (SoC), embedded memory, we can synthesize smarter and efficient embedded memory blocks that are customized to application needs. \nTo evaluate the efficacy of the proposed holistic DTCO process, we designed, fabricated and tested several design experiments in a state-of-the-art IBM 14SOI process. DTCOed leaf cells, standard cells and SRAM bitcells were robust during testing, but failed to meet node to node area scaling requirements. Holistic DTCO, when applied to a widely used parallel access SRAM sub-block, consumed 25% less area with a 50% better performance per watt compared to a traditional implementation using compiled SRAM blocks and standard cells. To extend the benefits of holistic DTCO to other embedded memory intensive sub-blocks in SoCs, we developed a readily customizable smart memory synthesis framework (SMSF). We believe that such an approach is important to establish an affordable path for sub-20 nm scaling.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Kaushik  Vaidyanathan"], "year": 2015, "n_citations": 6}

The set of quantum circuits that can be reliably run on NISQ devices is limited by their noisy operations and low qubit counts. This paper introduces CutQC, a scalable hybrid computing approach that combines classical computers and quantum computers to enable evaluation of quantum circuits that cannot be run on classical or quantum computers alone. CutQC cuts large quantum circuits into smaller subcircuits, allowing them to be executed on smaller quantum devices. Classical postprocessing can then reconstruct the output of the original circuit. This approach offers significant runtime speedup compared with the only viable current alternative\u2014purely classical simulations\u2014and demonstrates evaluation of quantum circuits that are larger than the limit of QC or classical simulation. Furthermore, in real-system runs, CutQC achieves much higher quantum circuit evaluation fidelity using small prototype quantum computers than the state-of-the-art large NISQ devices achieve.

We show that to address an industrial optimization problem, a hybrid architecture of CPUs and non-CPU devices is inevitable. In this paper, we propose problem decomposition as an effective method for designing a hybrid CPU--non-CPU optimization solver. We introduce the required algorithmic elements for making problem decomposition a viable approach in meeting the real-world constraints such as communication time and the potential higher cost of using non-CPU hardware. We then turn to the well-known maximum clique problem, and propose a new method of decomposition for this problem. Our method enables us to solve the maximum clique problem on very large graphs using non-CPU hardware that is considerably smaller than the size of the graph. As an example, we show that the maximum clique problem on the com-Amazon graph, with 334,863 vertices and 925,872 edges, can be solved with a single call to a device that can embed a fully connected graph of size at least 21 nodes, such as the D-Wave 2000Q.

In this work, we further extend the RPU concept for training recurrent neural networks (RNNs) namely LSTMs. We show that the mapping of recurrent layers is very similar to the mapping of fully connected layers and therefore the RPU concept can potentially provide large acceleration factors for RNNs as well. In addition, we study the effect of various device imperfections and system parameters on training performance. Symmetry of updates becomes even more crucial for RNNs; already a few percent asymmetry results in an increase in the test error compared to the ideal case trained with floating point numbers. Furthermore, the input signal resolution to the device arrays needs to be at least 7 bits for successful training. However, we show that a stochastic rounding scheme can reduce the input signal resolution back to 5 bits.

In practice, receptors are not ideally selective against target ligands, and in physiological environments, they can interact with multiple types of ligands at different reaction rates depending on their binding affinity. This molecular cross-talk can cause a substantial interference on MC. Here we consider a particular scenario, where there is non-negligible concentration of interferer molecules in the channel, which have similar receptor-binding characteristics with the information molecules, and the receiver employs single type of receptors. We investigate the performance of four different detection methods, which make use of different statistics of the ligand-receptor binding reactions: instantaneous number of bound receptors, unbound time durations of receptors, bound time durations of receptors, and combination of unbound and bound time durations of receptors within a sampling time interval. The performances of the introduced detection methods are evaluated in terms of bit error probability for varying strength of molecular interference, similarity between information and interferer molecules, number of receptors, and received concentration difference between bit-0 and bit-1 transmissions.

Specifically, memristors are an emerging high-density technology where the individual memristors can be used as storage or to perform computation. The voltage applied across a memristor determines its behavior (storage vs. compute), which enables a configurable memristor substrate that can embed computation with storage. \nThis paper explores accelerating point and range search queries as instances of the more general configurable combined compute and storage capabilities of memristor arrays. We first present MemCAM, a configurable memristor-based content addressable memory for the cases when fast, infrequent searches over large datasets are required. For frequent searches, memristor lifetime becomes a concern. To increase memristor array lifetime we introduce hybrid data structures that combine trees with MemCAM using conventional CMOS processor/cache hierarchies for the upper levels of the tree and configurable memristor technologies for lower levels. \nWe use SPICE to analyze energy consumption and access time of memristors and use analytic models to evaluate the performance of configurable hybrid data structures. The results show that with acceptable energy consumption our configurable hybrid data structures improve performance of search intensive applications and achieve lifetime in years or decades under continuous queries.

Here we describe an extensible co-design framework for solving chemistry problems on a trapped-ion quantum computer and apply it to estimating the ground-state energy of the water molecule using the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) method. The controllability of the trapped-ion quantum computer enables robust energy estimates using the prepared VQE ansatz states. The systematic and statistical errors are comparable to the chemical accuracy, which is the target threshold necessary for predicting the rates of chemical reaction dynamics, without resorting to any error mitigation techniques based on Richardson extrapolation.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Yun Seong Nam", "Jwo-Sy  Chen", "Neal C.

The energy-expensive transfer of data from the memory units to the computing cores results in the well-known von Neumann bottleneck. Various approaches aimed toward bypassing the von Neumann bottleneck are being extensively explored in the literature. These include in-memory computing based on CMOS and beyond CMOS technologies, wherein by making modifications to the memory array, vector computations can be carried out as close to the memory units as possible. Interestingly, in-memory techniques based on CMOS technology are of special importance due to the ubiquitous presence of field-effect transistors and the resultant ease of large-scale manufacturing and commercialization. On the other hand, perhaps the most important computation required for applications such as machine learning, etc., comprises the dot-product operation. Emerging nonvolatile memristive technologies have been shown to be very efficient in computing analog dot products in an in situ fashion. The memristive analog computation of the dot product results in much faster operation as opposed to digital vector in-memory bitwise Boolean computations. However, challenges with respect to large-scale manufacturing coupled with the limited endurance of memristors have hindered rapid commercialization of memristive-based computing solutions. In this paper, we show that the standard 8 transistor (8T) digital SRAM array can be configured as an analoglike in-memory multibit dot-product engine (DPE). By applying appropriate analog voltages to the read ports of the 8T SRAM array and sensing the output current, an approximate analog\u2013digital DPE can be implemented. We present two different configurations for enabling multibit dot-product computations in the 8T SRAM cell array, without modifying the standard bit-cell structure. We also demonstrate the robustness of the present proposal in presence of nonidealities such as the effect of line resistances and transistor threshold voltage variations.

Their concepts are motivated by the fact that the information lost from conventional circuits results in an entropy increase which causes energy dissipation. To overcome this issue, computations are performed in a (conditionally) reversible fashion which, additionally, have to satisfy switching rules that are different from conventional circuitry---crying out for dedicated design automation solutions. While previous approaches either focus on their electrical realization (resulting in small, hand-crafted circuits only) or on designing fully reversible building blocks (an unnecessary overhead), this work aims for providing an automatic and dedicated design scheme that explicitly takes the recent findings in this domain into account. To this end, we review the theoretical and technical background of adiabatic circuits and present automated methods that dedicatedly realize the desired function as an adiabatic circuit.

First, we demonstrate how current state-of-the-art delay-based geolocation techniques are susceptible to evasion through delay manipulations. We found that delay-based techniques generally lack appropriate mechanisms to measure delays in an integrity-preserving manner. Upon analyzing the effect of several adversarial evasion strategies on three representative delay-based geolocation techniques, we found that these strategies combined with the ability of full delay manipulation can allow an adversary to (fraudulently) control the location returned by those geolocation techniques accurately.\nClient Presence Verification (CPV) is then proposed as a delay-based technique to verify an assertion about a client's physical presence in a prescribed geographic region. Three verifiers geographically encapsulating a client's asserted location are used to corroborate that assertion by measuring delays between themselves and the client. CPV infers geographic distances from these delays and thus, using the smaller of the forward and reverse one-way delay between each verifier and the client is expected to result in a more accurate distance inference than conventional round-trip times. Accordingly, we devise a novel protocol for accurately estimating one-way delays between the client and the verifiers for CPV to use, taking into account that the client could manipulate the measurements to defeat the verification process.\nCPV is evaluated through real-world experiments with legitimate clients (those truly present at where they asserted to be) modeled to use both wired and wireless access networks. Wired evaluation is done using the PlanetLab testbed, during which we examine various factors affecting CPV's efficacy. For wireless evaluation, we leverage the Internet delay information collected for wired clients from PlanetLab, and model additional delays representing the last-mile wireless link using delay distribution models studied in the literature.\nFinally, we reinforce CPV against a (hypothetical) middlebox that an adversary specifically customizes to defeat CPV (i.e., assuming an adversary that is aware of how CPV operates). We propose to use a Proof-of-Work mechanism that allows CPV to impose constraints which effectively limit the number of clients (now adversaries) simultaneously colluding with that middlebox; beyond that number, CPV detects the middlebox.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["AbdelRahman  Abdou"], "year": 2018, "n_citations": 1}

In this scheme, a temporal waveform is generated by different dynamic source models that change over time.

We prepare two types of output weights for the source models, and the system adaptively selected the correct model using reinforcement learning, where the prediction errors are associated with rewards.

Synaptic devices, in the form of synaptic transistors, have been studied using a wide variety of materials. However, studies on metallic channel based synaptic transistors remain vastly unexplored. Here, we have demonstrated a three-terminal cobalt-based synaptic transistor to emulate biological synapse.

The to-and-fro movement of data leads to a fundamental limitation of modern computers, known as the Memory wall . Logic in-Memory (LIM)/In-Memory Computing (IMC) approaches aim to address this bottleneck by directly computing inside memory units thereby eliminating energy-intensive and time-consuming data movement. Several recent works in literature, propose realization of logic function(s) directly using arrays of emerging resistive memory devices (example- memristors, RRAM/ReRAM, PCM, CBRAM, OxRAM, STT-MRAM etc.), rather than using conventional transistors for computing. The logic/embedded-side of digital systems (like processors, micro-controllers) can greatly benefit from such LIM realizations. However, the pure storage-side of digital systems (example SSDs, enterprise storage etc.) will not benefit much from such LIM approaches as when memory arrays are used for logic they lose their core functionality of storage. Thus, there is the need for an approach complementary to existing LIM techniques, that\u2019s more beneficial for the storage-side of digital systems; one that gives compute capability to memory arrays not at the cost of their existing stored states. Fundamentally, this would require memory nanodevice arrays that are capable of storing and computing simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a novel \u2018Simultaneous Logic in-Memory\u2019 (SLIM) methodology which is complementary to existing LIM approaches in literature. Through extensive experiments we demonstrate novel SLIM bitcells (1T-1R/2T-1R) comprising non-filamentary bilayer analog OxRAM devices with NMOS transistors. Proposed bitcells are capable of implementing both Memory and Logic operations simultaneously. Detailed programming scheme, array level implementation, and controller architecture are also proposed. Furthermore, to study the impact of proposed SLIM approach for real-world implementations, we performed analysis for two applications: (i) Sobel Edge Detection, and (ii) Binary Neural Network- Multi layer Perceptron (BNN-MLP). By performing all computations in SLIM bitcell array, huge Energy Delay Product (EDP) savings of \u224875\u00d7 for 1T-1R (\u224840\u00d7 for 2T-1R) SLIM bitcell were observed for edge-detection application while EDP savings of \u22483.5\u00d7 for 1T-1R (\u22481.6\u00d7 for 2T-1R) SLIM bitcell were observed for BNN-MLP application respectively, in comparison to conventional computing.

In this work, we focus on a diffusion-based communication system where the reception process is an absorption via receptors. Whenever a molecule hits to the receiver it is removed from the environment. This kind of reception process is called first passage process and it is more complicated compared to diffusion process only. In 3-D environments, obtaining analytical solution for hitting time distribution for realistic cases is complicated, hence we develop an end-to-end simulator for he diffusion-based communication system that sends consecutive symbols. \nIn CvD, each symbol is modulated and demodulated in a time slot called symbol duration, however the long tail distribution of hitting time is the main challenge that affects the symbol detection error. The molecules arriving in the following slots become an interference source when detection takes place. End-to-end simulator enables us to analyze the effect of inter symbol interference (ISI) without making any assumptions on the ISI. We propose an ISI cancellation technique that utilizes decision feedback for compensating the effect of previously demodulated symbol. Three different modulation types are considered with pulse, square, and cosine carrier waves. In case of constraints on transmitter or receiver node it may not be possible to use pulse as a carrier, and peak-to-average messenger molecule metric is defined for this purpose.

In this work, we evaluate embedding the PCM within the silicon device layer of an electronic device to minimize the thermal resistance between the source and the PCM to minimize this thermal resistance and enhance the thermal performance of the device. The geometry and material properties of the embedded PCM regions are optimized using a combination of parametric and machine learning algorithms. For a fixed geometry, considering commercially available materials, Solder 174 significantly outperforms other organic and metallic PCMs. Also with a fixed geometry, the optimal melting points to minimize the peak temperature is higher than the optimal melting point to minimize the amplitude of the transient temperature oscillation, and both optima increase with increasing heater power. Extending beyond conventional optimization strategies, genetic algorithms and particle swarm optimization with and without neural network surrogate models are used to enable optimization of many geometric and material properties. For the test case evaluated, the optimized geometries and properties are similar between all ML-assisted algorithms, but the computational time depends on the technique.

In parallel, spiking neural network (SNN) architectures are explored to further reduce power when processing sparse event-based data streams, while on-chip spike-based online learning appears as a key feature for applications constrained in power and resources during the training phase.

Implementing classical adding circuits using unconventional, or even living substrates such as slime mould Physarum polycephalum, is made difficult and often impractical by the challenges of branching fan-out of inputs and regions where circuit lines must cross without interference. In this report we explore whether it is possible to avoid spatial propagation, branching and crossing completely in the design of adding circuits. We analyse the input and output patterns of a single-bit full adder circuit. A simple quantitative transformation of the input patterns which considers the total number of bits in the input string allows us to map the respective input combinations to the correct outputs patterns of the full adder circuit, reducing the circuit combinations from a 2:1 mapping to a 1:1 mapping. The mapping of inputs to outputs also shows an incremental linear progression, suggesting its implementation in a range of physical systems. We demonstrate an example implementation, first in simulation, inspired by self-oscillatory dynamics of the acellular slime mould P. polycephalum.

We argue that, to achieve their full potential as economic boosters in developing countries, mobile payment systems need to rely on new metaphors suitable for the business models, lifestyle, and technology availability conditions of the targeted communities. The Pay-with-a-Group-Selfie (PGS) project, funded by the Melinda & Bill Gates Foundation, has developed a micro-payment system that supports everyday small transactions by extending the reach of, rather than substituting, existing payment frameworks. PGS is based on a simple gesture and a readily understandable metaphor. The gesture - taking a selfie - has become part of the lifestyle of mobile phone users worldwide, including non-technology-savvy ones. The metaphor likens computing two visual shares of the selfie to ripping a banknote in two, a technique used for decades for delayed payment in cash-only markets. PGS is designed to work with devices with limited computational power and when connectivity is patchy or not always available.

However, their analog nature of computing poses significant issues due to various non-idealities such as: parasitic resistances, non-linear I-V characteristics of the memristor device etc. The non-idealities can have a detrimental impact on the functionality i.e. computational accuracy of crossbars. Past works have explored modeling the non-idealities using analytical techniques. However, several non-idealities have data dependent behavior. This can not be captured using analytical (non data-dependent) models thereby, limiting their suitability in predicting application accuracy. To address this, we propose a Generalized Approach to Emulating Non-Ideality in Memristive Crossbars using Neural Networks (GENIEx), which accurately captures the data-dependent nature of non-idealities. First, we perform extensive HSPICE simulations of crossbars with different voltage and conductance combinations. Based on the obtained data, we train a neural network to learn the transfer characteristics of the non-ideal crossbar. Next, we build a functional simulator which includes key architectural facets such as tiling, and bit-slicing to analyze the impact of non-idealities on the classification accuracy of large-scale neural networks. We show that GENIEx achieves low root mean square errors (RMSE) of 0.25 and 0.7 for low and high voltages, respectively, compared to HSPICE. Additionally, the GENIEx errors are 7\u00d7 and 12.8\u00d7 better than an analytical model which can only capture the linear non-idealities. Further, using the functional simulator and GENIEx, we demonstrate that an analytical model can overestimate the degradation in classification accuracy by \u2265 10% on CIFAR-100 and 3.7% on ImageNet datasets compared to GENIEx.", "venue": "2020 57th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference (DAC)", "authors": ["Indranil  Chakraborty", "Mustafa Fayez Ali", "Dong Eun Kim", "Aayush  Ankit", "Kaushik  Roy"], "year": 2020, "n_citations": 21}

Relatively little attention has been given to using the compiler output to fully control the operations on experimental quantum processors. Bridging this gap, we propose and build a prototype of a flexible control microarchitecture supporting quantum-classical mixed code for a superconducting quantum processor.

Instead, we exploit the Johnson (thermal) noise generated by a resistor to transmit information bits wirelessly. By switching the load connected to an antenna between a resistor and open circuit, we can achieve data rates of up to 26bps and distances of up to 7.3 meters. This communication method is orders of magnitude less power consuming than conventional communication schemes and presents the opportunity to enable wireless communication in areas with a complete lack of connectivity. One-Sentence Summary: Modulated Johnson noise is a means of enabling a fundamentally new passive form of wireless communication. In passive wireless communication, an energy-constrained data transmitter sends information by modulating an RF signal generated by an RF source that is not power constrained. Because the data transmitter does not have to generate an RF signal, the power necessary to send data is orders of magnitude less than in conventional RF communication. In Modulated Backscatter Communication, a continuous wave RF carrier is generated by a dedicated device on the highpower side of the link. The low power side encodes data by selectively reflecting this RF signal [1]. Ambient Backscatter is another form of passive communication that uses pre-existing, ambient RF signals such as those generated by broadcast TV or radio towers [2]. While the low power of the data transmission side is attractive, both methods rely on a pre-existing RF signal. This report introduces a new form of passive wireless communication, Modulated Johnson Noise, in which the signal to be modulated is the Johnson noise in an unbiased (un-powered) resistor. This scheme retains the benefits of prior passive wireless communication schemes while eliminating the need for an external RF signal. This new method of communication has the potential to reduce the overall energy consumption of the system, allow more stealthy and lowinterference operation, and allow operation in areas where no ambient RF signals are available. We note that the Johnson noise generated by a resistor can be represented as, Pn = kBT\u0394f, where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is temperature, and \u0394f is the bandwidth [3]. Information bits can be modulated by selectively choosing between a resistor load and an open or short circuit connection to an antenna. Consider the frequency spectrum measurements shown in Fig. 1a. We can see a clear difference between open and 50\u03a9 RF terminators. Fig. 1b shows the noise power measurements for a 50\u03a9 terminator and short and open circuit terminators. There is approximately a 6dB difference between 50\u03a9 and an open or short circuit. By exploiting this difference in noise power, information bits can be modulated and transmitted wirelessly. 1 The system provides ~84dB of gain, has a bandwidth of 500MHz, and data was collected at room temperature. Thus, the expected thermal noise power for the 50\u03a9 RF terminator would be approximately -32.87dBm.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Zerina  Kapetanovic", "Joshua R.

A fundamental problem is to map an arbitrary matrix to a memristor crossbar array (MCA) while maximizing the resulting computational accuracy. The state-of-the-art mapping technique is based on a heuristic that only guarantees to produce the correct output for two input vectors. In this paper, a technique that aims to produce the correct output for every input vector is proposed, which involves specifying the memristor conductance values and a scaling factor realized by the peripheral circuitry. The key insight of the paper is that the conductance matrix realized by an MCA is only required to be proportional to the target matrix. The selection of the scaling factor between the two regulates the utilization of the programmable memristor conductance range and the representability of the target matrix. Consequently, the scaling factor is set to balance precision and value range errors. Moreover, a technique of converting conductance values into state variables and vice versa is proposed to handle memristors with non-ideal device characteristics. Compared with the state-of-the-art technique, the proposed mapping results in 4X-9X smaller errors.

Memcomputing is a novel non-Turing paradigm of computation that uses interacting memory cells (memprocessors for short) to store and process information on the same physical platform. It was recently proven mathematically that memcomputing machines have the same computational power of nondeterministic Turing machines. Therefore, they can solve NP-complete problems in polynomial time and, using the appropriate architecture, with resources that only grow polynomially with the input size. The reason for this computational power stems from properties inspired by the brain and shared by any universal memcomputing machine, in particular intrinsic parallelism and information overhead, namely, the capability of compressing information in the collective state of the memprocessor network. We show an experimental demonstration of an actual memcomputing architecture that solves the NP-complete version of the subset sum problem in only one step and is composed of a number of memprocessors that scales linearly with the size of the problem.

Recent microfluidic technologies offer suitable platforms for automating dilutions on-chip, and typically on a digital microfluidic biochip (DMFB), a sequence of (1:1) mix-split operations is performed on fluid droplets to achieve the target concentration factor (CF) of a sample. An (1:1) mixing model ideally comprises mixing of two unit-volume droplets followed by a (balanced) splitting into two unit-volume daughter-droplets. However, a major source of error in fluidic operations is due to unbalanced splitting, where two unequal-volume droplets are produced following a split. Such volumetric split-errors occurring in different mix-split steps of the reaction path often cause a significant drift in the target-CF of the sample, the precision of which cannot be compromised in life-critical assays. In order to circumvent this problem, several error-recovery or error-tolerant techniques have been proposed recently for DMFBs. Unfortunately, the impact of such fluidic errors on a target-CF and the dynamics of their behavior have not yet been rigorously analyzed. In this work, we investigate the effect of multiple volumetric split-errors on various target-CFs during sample preparation. We also perform a detailed analysis of the worst-case scenario, i.e., the condition when the error in a target-CF is maximized.

However, the large storage overheads and the substantial computation cost of CNNs are problematic in hardware accelerators. Computing-in-memory (CIM) architecture has demonstrated great potential to effectively compute large-scale matrix-vector multiplication. However, the intensive multiply and accumulation (MAC) operations executed at the crossbar array and the limited capacity of CIM macros remain bottlenecks for further improvement of energy efficiency and throughput. To reduce computation costs, network pruning and quantization are two widely studied compression methods to shrink the model size. However, most of the model compression algorithms can only be implemented in digital-based CNN accelerators. For implementation in a static random access memory (SRAM) CIM-based accelerator, the model compression algorithm must consider the hardware limitations of CIM macros, such as the number of word lines and bit lines that can be turned on at the same time, as well as how to map the weight to the SRAM CIM macro. In this study, a software and hardware co-design approach is proposed to design an SRAM CIM-based CNN accelerator and an SRAM CIM-aware model compression algorithm. To lessen the high-precision MAC required by batch normalization (BN), a quantization algorithm that can fuse BN into the weights is proposed. Furthermore, to reduce the number of network parameters, a sparsity algorithm that considers a CIM architecture is proposed.

This is done by mapping a problem onto the physical qubits and couplers of the quantum chip, from which a solution is read after a process called quantum annealing. However, this process is subject to multiple sources of biases, including poor calibration, leakage between adjacent qubits, control biases, etc., which might negatively influence the quality of the annealing results. In this work, we aim at mitigating the effect of such biases for solving constrained optimization problems, by offering a two-step method, and apply it to Graph Partitioning. In the first step, we measure and reduce any biases that result from implementing the constraints of the problem. In the second, we add the objective function to the resulting bias-corrected implementation of the constraints, and send the problem to the quantum annealer. We apply this concept to Graph Partitioning, an important NP-hard problem, which asks to find a partition of the vertices of a graph that is balanced (the constraint) and minimizes the cut size (the objective). We first quantify the bias of the implementation of the constraint on the quantum annealer, that is, we require, in an unbiased implementation, that any two vertices have the same likelihood of being assigned to the same or to different parts of the partition. We then propose an iterative method to correct any such biases.

The challenge of ST-MRAM, however, is that it is prone to write errors and usually requires the use of error correction. In this work, we show that these bit errors can be tolerated by BNNs to an outstanding level, based on examples of image recognition tasks (MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet): bit error rates of ST-MRAM up to 0.1% have little impact on recognition accuracy. The requirements for ST-MRAM are therefore considerably relaxed for BNNs with regards to traditional applications. By consequence, we show that for BNNs, ST-MRAMs can be programmed with weak (low-energy) programming conditions, without error correcting codes.

Compared to Service-oriented Architecture (SOA), MSA puts a stronger focus on self-containment of services. Each microservice is responsible for realizing exactly one business or technological capability that is distinct from other services' capabilities. Additionally, on the implementation and operation level, microservices are self-contained in that they are developed, tested, deployed and operated independently from each other. Next to these characteristics that distinguish MSA from SOA, both architectural styles rely on services as building blocks of distributed software architecture and hence face similar challenges regarding, e.g., service identification, composition and provisioning. However, in contrast to MSA, SOA may rely on an extensive body of knowledge to tackle these challenges. Thus, due to both architectural styles being service-based, the question arises to what degree MSA might draw on existing findings of SOA research and practice. In this paper we address this question in the field of Model-driven Development (MDD) for design and operation of service-based architectures. Therefore, we present an analysis of existing MDD approaches to SOA, which comprises the identification and semantic clustering of modeling concepts for SOA design and operation.

This work takes its inspiration from two strategies used by the brain to achieve this energy efficiency: the absence of separation between computing and memory functions and reliance on low-precision computation. The emergence of resistive memory technologies indeed provides an opportunity to tightly co-integrate logic and memory in hardware. In parallel, the recently proposed concept of a Binarized Neural Network, where multiplications are replaced by exclusive NOR (XNOR) logic gates, offers a way to implement artificial intelligence using very low precision computation. In this work, we therefore propose a strategy for implementing low-energy Binarized Neural Networks that employs brain-inspired concepts while retaining the energy benefits of digital electronics. We design, fabricate, and test a memory array, including periphery and sensing circuits, that is optimized for this in-memory computing scheme. Our circuit employs hafnium oxide resistive memory integrated in the back end of line of a 130-nm CMOS process, in a two-transistor, two-resistor cell, which allows the exclusive NOR operations of the neural network to be performed directly within the sense amplifiers. We show, based on extensive electrical measurements, that our design allows a reduction in the number of bit errors on the synaptic weights without the use of formal error-correcting codes. We design a whole system using this memory array. We show on standard machine learning tasks (MNIST, CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and an ECG task) that the system has inherent resilience to bit errors.

Our work explores the feasibility of using the D-Wave as a sampler for a machine learning task. We describe a hybrid method that combines a classical deep neural network autoencoder with a quantum annealing Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) using the D-Wave for image generation. Our method overcomes two key limitations in the 2000-qubit D-Wave processor, namely the limited number of qubits available to accommodate typical problem sizes for fully connected quantum objective functions, and samples that are binary pixel representations. As a consequence of these limitations we are able to show how we achieved nearly a 22-fold compression factor of grayscale 28 x 28 sized images to binary 6 x 6 sized images with a lossy recovery of the original 28 x 28 grayscale images. We further show how generating samples from the D-Wave after training the RBM, resulted in 28 x 28 images that were variations of the original input data distribution, as opposed to recreating the training samples. We evaluated the quality of this method by using a downstream classification method. We formulated a MNIST classification problem using a deep convolutional neural network that used samples from the quantum RBM to train the MNIST classifier and compared the results with a MNIST classifier trained with the original MNIST training data set, as well as a MNIST classifier trained using classical RBM samples. We also explored using a secondary dataset, the MNIST Fashion dataset and demonstrate the first quantum-generated fashion. Our hybrid autoencoder approach indicates advantage for RBM results relative to the use of a current RBM classical computer implementation for image-based machine learning and even more promising results for the next generation D-Wave quantum system.

Keywords: Mobile Cloud Computing, Mobile Health Monitoring, WBASN, Smartphone, Android, Python. 1.Introduction & Related Works Recent technological advances in sensors facilitate wireless sensor networks that are deeply embedded in their native environments. Wireless sensor networks are highly suitable for many applications, such as habitat monitoring [1], machine health monitoring and guidance, traffic pattern monitoring and navigation, plant monitoring in agriculture [2], and infrastructure monitoring. The current technological and economic trends enable new generations of wireless sensor networks with more compact and lighter sensor nodes, more processing power, and more storage capacity. In addition, the ongoing proliferation of wireless sensor networks across many application domains will result in a significant cost reduction. One of the most promising application domains is health monitoring [3], and within health care, WBANs in particular are emerging as promising enabling technologies to implement m-health. A WBASN for health monitoring consists of multiple sensor nodes that can measure and report the user\u2019s physiological state. These sensors are strategically placed on the human body. The exact location of the sensor nodes on the human body depend on the sensor type, size and weight. Sensors can be worn as stand-alone devices or can be built into jewelry, applied as tiny patches on the skin, hidden in the user\u2019s clothes or shoes, or even implanted in the user\u2019s body. Each node in the WBASN is typically capable of sensing, sampling, processing, and wirelessly communicating one or more physiological signals. The exact number and type of physiological signals to be measured, processed, and reported, depends on end-user application and may include many physiological sensors (ECG, EMG, EEG, SPO2\u2026). In addition to these sensors, a WBASN for health monitoring may include sensors that can help to determine the user\u2019s location, discriminate among the user\u2019s states (e.g., lying, sitting, walking, running), or estimate the type and level of the user\u2019s physical activity. In this paper, we describe new Mobile Health Monitoring system architecture, it uses a wireless body area networks (WBASN) to collect and send data to the cloud server through GPRS/UMTS [4]. The system uses a cloud service to extract patient data information. These sensory parameters are fed into a neural network engine running as a cloud service that fuses information from multiple disparate sensors to determine whether the patient is in a \"danger state\". The merger of mobile computing and cloud resources is one of the popular areas of research today. There are several application including mobile social application [5], healthcare application [6, 7], gamming [8], and localization [9] that leverage cloud resources and machine learning algorithms to design efficient systems. The tradeoff lies in between energy consumption and computability, and in some cases best of both words can be leveraged. Choi et al. [10] proposed a system for ubiquitous health monitoring in the Bedroom via a Bluetooth Network and Wireless LAN. The information gathered from sensors connected to the patient's bed is transmitted to a monitoring station outside of the room where the data is processed and analyzed. Using the technologies of wireless body area networks (WBAN), Jovanov et al. [11] presented a Wearable health systems using WBAN for patient monitoring. The first level consists of physiological sensors, the second level is the personal server, and the third level is the health care servers and related services.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Abderrahim  Bourouis", "Mohammed  Feham", "Abdelhamid  Bouchachia"], "year": 2012, "n_citations": 44}

Applications span from automatic classification for big data management, through unmanned vehicle control, to control for biomedical prosthesis. However, one of the major challenges of fabricating bioinspired hardware is building ultrahigh-density networks out of complex processing units interlinked by tunable connections. Nanometer-scale devices exploiting spin electronics (or spintronics) can be a key technology in this context. In particular, magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) are well suited for this purpose because of their multiple tunable functionalities. One such functionality, nonvolatile memory, can provide massive embedded memory in unconventional circuits, thus escaping the von-Neumann bottleneck arising when memory and processors are located separately. Other features of spintronic devices that could be beneficial for bioinspired computing include tunable fast nonlinear dynamics, controlled stochasticity, and the ability of single devices to change functions in different operating conditions. Large networks of interacting spintronic nanodevices can have their interactions tuned to induce complex dynamics such as synchronization, chaos, soliton diffusion, phase transitions, criticality, and convergence to multiple metastable states. A number of groups have recently proposed bioinspired architectures that include one or several types of spintronic nanodevices.

To achieve its self-sustainability, IRS collects energy from the energy station to support its own control circuit operation. Our proposed policy for the considered WPSN is called IRS assisted harvest-then-transmit time switching (IRS-HTT-TS), which is capable to schedule the transmission time slots by switching between energy collection and energy reflection modes. We provide a joint design of the transmission time slots, the power allocation as well as the discrete phase shifts of the WET and WIT, aiming to maximize the system sum throughput. This formulates a problem as a mixed-integer non-linear program (MINLP), which is NP-hard and non-convex. To effectively solve this problem, we first relax it to the one with continuous phase shifts, and then propose a two-step approach and decompose the original problem into two sub-problems. We address the first sub-problem in closed form with respect to the phase shifts of the WIT. For the second sub-problem, we apply the Lagrange dual method and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions to derive the optimal closed-form transmission time slots, power allocation, and phase shift of the WET, respectively. The optimal discrete phase shifts can be obtained by quantizing the continuous values.

In fact, no program needs to be written: it learns by itself and writes its own program to solve a problem. Godel\u2019s incompleteness argument is explored here to devise an engine where an astronomically large number of \u201cif-then\u201d arguments are allowed to grow by self-assembly, based on the basic set of arguments written in the system, thus, we explore the beyond Turing path of computing but following a fundamentally different route adopted in the last half-a-century old non-Turing adventures. Our hardware is a multilayered seed structure. If we open the largest seed, which is the final hardware, we find several computing seed structures inside, if we take any of them and open, there are several computing seeds inside. We design and synthesize the smallest seed, the entire multilayered architecture grows by itself. The electromagnetic resonance band of each seed looks similar, but the seeds of any layer shares a common region in its resonance band with inner and upper layer, hence a chain of resonance bands is formed (frequency fractal) connecting the smallest to the largest seed (hence the name invincible rhythm or Ajeya Chhandam in Sanskrit). The computer solves intractable pattern search (Clique) problem without searching, since the right pattern written in it spontaneously replies back to the questioner. To learn, the hardware filters any kind of sensory input image into several layers of images, each containing basic geometric polygons (fractal decomposition), and builds a network among all layers, multi-sensory images are connected in all possible ways to generate \u201cif\u201d and \u201cthen\u201d argument. Several such arguments and decisions (phase transition from \u201cif\u201d to \u201cthen\u201d) self-assemble and form the two giant columns of arguments and rules of phase transition. Any input question is converted into a pattern as noted above, and these two astronomically large columns project a solution. The driving principle of computing is synchronization and de-synchronization of network paths, the system drives towards highest density of coupled arguments for maximum matching. Memory is located at all layers of the hardware. Learning, computing occurs everywhere simultaneously. Since resonance chain connects all computing seeds, wireless processing is feasible without a screening effect. The computing power is increased by maximizing the density of resonance states and bandwidth of the resonance chain together. We discovered this remarkable computing while studying the human brain, so we present a new model of the human brain in terms of an experimentally determined resonance chain with bandwidth 10\u221215 Hz (complete brain with all sensors) to 10+15 Hz (DNA) along with its implementation using a pure organic synthesis of entire computer (brain jelly) in our lab, software prototype as proof of concept and finally a new fourth circuit element (Hinductor) based beyond Complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) hardware is also presented.", "venue": "Inf.", "authors": ["Subrata  Ghosh", "Krishna  Aswani", "Surabhi  Singh", "Satyajit  Sahu", "Daisuke  Fujita", "Anirban  Bandyopadhyay"], "year": 2014, "n_citations": 31}

Such architectures, however, leverage charge conservation, an operation with infinite resolution, and thus are susceptible to errors. The computations in DNN realized by analog NVM thus have high uncertainty due to the device stochasticity. Several reports have demonstrated the use of analog NVM for CIM in a limited scale. It is unclear whether the uncertainties in computations will prohibit large-scale DNNs. To explore this critical issue of scalability, this paper first presents a simulation framework to evaluate the feasibility of large-scale DNNs based on CIM architecture and analog NVM. Simulation results show that DNNs trained for high-precision digital computing engines are not resilient against the uncertainty of the analog NVM devices. To avoid such catastrophic failures, this paper introduces the analog floating-point representation for the DNN, and the Hessian-Aware Stochastic Gradient Descent (HA-SGD) training algorithm to enhance the inference accuracy of trained DNNs.

This problem arises often in the thermodynamics of computation and nonequilibrium statistical physics more generally (e.g., when designing processes to implement some desired computation, feedback controller, or Maxwell demon). It was previously known that some conditional distributions cannot be implemented using any master equation that involves just the states in $X$. However, here we show that any conditional distribution $P$ can in fact be implemented---if additional \"hidden\" states not in $X$ are available. Moreover, we show that it is always possible to implement $P$ in a thermodynamically reversible manner. We then investigate a novel cost of the physical resources needed to implement a given distribution $P$: the minimal number of hidden states needed to do so. We calculate this cost exactly for the special case where $P$ represents a single-valued function, and provide an upper bound for the general case, in terms of the nonnegative rank of $P$. These results show that having access to one extra binary degree of freedom, thus doubling the total number of states, is sufficient to implement any $P$ with a master equation in a thermodynamically reversible way, if there are no constraints on the allowed form of the master equation. (Such constraints can greatly increase the minimal needed number of hidden states.) Our results also imply that for certain $P$ that can be implemented without hidden states, having hidden states permits an implementation that generates less heat.", "venue": "New Journal of Physics", "authors": ["Jeremy A.

Furthermore, by combining such naturally constructed complex photon transmission with a simple photon detection protocol, Schubert polynomials, the foundation of versatile permutation operations in mathematics, have been generated. In this study, we demonstrate an order recognition algorithm inspired by Schubert calculus using optical near-field statistics via nanometre-scale photochromism. More specifically, by utilizing Schubert polynomials generated via optical near-field patterns, we show that the order of slot machines with initially unknown reward probability is successfully recognized. We emphasize that, unlike conventional algorithms in the literature, the proposed principle does not estimate the reward probabilities. Instead, it exploits the inversion relations contained in the Schubert polynomials. To quantitatively evaluate the impact of the Schubert 2 polynomials generated from an optical near-field pattern, order recognition performances are compared with uniformly distributed and spatially strongly skewed probability distributions, where the optical near-field pattern outperforms the others. We found that the number of singularities contained in Schubert polynomials and that of the given problem or considered environment exhibits a clear correspondence, indicating that superior order recognition performances may be attained if the singularity of the given problem is presupposed.

We also demonstrate that a UMM has the same computational power as a nondeterministic Turing machine, namely, it can solve nondeterministic polynomial (NP)-complete problems in polynomial time. However, by virtue of its information overhead, a UMM needs only an amount of memory cells (memprocessors) that grows polynomially with the problem size. As an example, we provide the polynomial-time solution of the subset-sum problem and a simple hardware implementation of the same.

An elementary QCA device called a \u201ccell\u201d is made from a system of coupled quantum dots with a few mobile charges. The cell's charge configuration encodes a bit, and quantum charge tunneling within a cell enables device switching. Arrays of cells networked locally via the electrostatic field form QCA circuits, which mix logic, memory and device interconnections. A molecular QCA implementation promises ultra-high device densities, high switching speeds, and room-temperature operation. We propose a novel approach to the technical challenge of transducing bits from larger conventional devices to nanoscale QCA molecules. This signal transduction begins with lithographically formed electrodes placed on the device plane. A voltage applied across these electrodes establishes an in-plane electric field, which selects a bit packet on a large QCA input circuit. A typical QCA binary wire may be used to transmit a smaller bit packet of size more suitable for processing from this input to other QCA circuitry. In contrast to previous concepts for bit inputs to molecular QCA, this approach requires neither special QCA cells with fixed states nor nanoelectrodes that establish fields with single-electron specificity. A brief overview of the QCA paradigm is given. Proof-of-principle simulation results are shown, demonstrating the input concept in circuits made from two-dot QCA cells. Importantly, this concept for bit inputs to molecular QCA may enable solutions to or provide insights into other challenges to the realization of molecular QCA, such as the demonstration of molecular device switching, the read-out of molecular QCA states, and the layout of molecular QCA circuits.", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology", "authors": ["Enrique  Blair"], "year": 2019, "n_citations": 12}

For the first one we assume an unsorted names database set up by Alice that is a superposition (unknown by Bob) of up to n = 2N strings; those we call names. Bob has access to the superposition wave and to the 2N reference noises of the INBL system of N noise bits. For Bob, to decide if a given name x is included in the superposition, once the search has begun, it takes N switching operations followed by a single measurement of the superposition wave.

Microbial communication regulates many virulence mechanisms used by bacteria. Thus, it is of fundamental importance to understand interactions in microbial communities and to develop predictive tools that help control them, in order to aid the design of systems exploiting bacterial capabilities. This position paper explores how abstractions from communications, networking and information theory can play a role in understanding and modeling bacterial interactions. In particular, two forms of interactions in bacterial systems will be examined: electron transfer and quorum sensing. While the diffusion of chemical signals has been heavily studied, electron transfer occurring in living cells and its role in cell-cell interaction is less understood. Recent experimental observations open up new frontiers in the design of microbial systems based on electron transfer, which may coexist with the more well-known interaction strategies based on molecular diffusion. In quorum sensing, the concentration of certain signature chemical compounds emitted by the bacteria is used to estimate the bacterial population size, so as to activate collective behaviors. In this position paper, queuing models for electron transfer are summarized and adapted to provide new models for quorum sensing. These models are stochastic, and thus capture the inherent randomness exhibited by cell colonies in nature. It is shown that queuing models allow the characterization of the state of a single cell as a function of interactions with other cells and the environment, thus enabling the construction of an information theoretic framework, while being amenable to complexity reduction using methods based on statistical physics and wireless network design.", "venue": "IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications", "authors": ["Nicol\u00f2  Michelusi", "James  Boedicker", "Mohamed Y.

We introduce the Effective Geometry Monte Carlo (EG-MC) simulation algorithm which modifies the geometry of the receiver. We motivate our approach in a 1D toy model and then apply our findings to a spherical absorbing receiver in a 3D unbounded environment. We show that with minimal computational cost the impulse response of this receiver can be precisely simulated using EG-MC. Afterwards, we demonstrate the accuracy of our simulations and give tight constraints on the single free parameter in EG-MC. Finally, we comment on the range of applicability of our results. While we present the EG-MC algorithm for the specific case of molecular diffusion, we believe that analogous methods with effective geometry manipulations can be utilized to approach a variety of problems in other branches of physics such as condensed matter physics and cosmological large scale structure simulations.", "venue": "Physics Letters A", "authors": ["Fatih  Dinc", "Leander  Thiele", "B.

We provide capacity bounds for each scheme and discuss their relative utility. We find that under not unreasonable assumptions, megabit per second rates could be supported at 100 femtoWatt transmitter powers. Since quantities such as token concentration or token counting are derivatives of token arrival timing, token timing undergirds all molecular communication techniques.

The model system under study represents two oscillators based on thermally coupled VO2 switches. Numerical simulation shows that the effective action radius RTC of coupling depends both on the total energy released during switching and on the average power. It is experimentally and numerically proved that the temperature change \u0394T commences almost synchronously with the released power peak and T-coupling reveals itself up to a frequency of about 10\u202fkHz. For the studied switching structure configuration, the RTC value varies over a wide range from 4 to 45\u202f\u03bcm, depending on the external circuit capacitance C and resistance Ri, but the variation of Ri is more promising from the practical viewpoint. In the case of a \u201cweak\u201d coupling, synchronization is accompanied by attraction effect and decrease of the main spectra harmonics width. In the case of a \u201cstrong\u201d coupling, the number of effects increases, synchronization can occur on subharmonics resulting in multilevel stable synchronization of two oscillators. An advanced algorithm for synchronization efficiency and subharmonic ratio calculation is proposed. It is shown that of the two oscillators the leading one is that with a higher main frequency, and, in addition, the frequency stabilization effect is observed. Also, in the case of a strong thermal coupling, the limit of the supply current parameters, for which the oscillations exist, expands by \u223c10%.

The design of quantum circuits for integer division has caught the attention of researchers and designs have been proposed in the literature. However, these designs suffer from excessive T gate and qubit costs. Many of these designs also produce significant garbage output resulting in additional qubit and T gate costs to eliminate these outputs.

In this paper, we investigate the influence of the hierarchical reservoir structure on the properties of the reservoir and the performance of the RC system. Analogous to deep neural networks, stacking sub-reservoirs in series is an efficient way to enhance the nonlinearity of data transformation to high-dimensional space and expand the diversity of temporal information captured by the reservoir. These deep reservoir systems offer better performance when compared to simply increasing the size of the reservoir or the number of sub-reservoirs. Low frequency components are mainly captured by the sub-reservoirs in later stage of the deep reservoir structure, similar to observations that more abstract information can be extracted by layers in the late stage of deep neural networks. When the total size of the reservoir is fixed, tradeoff between the number of sub-reservoirs and the size of each sub-reservoir needs to be carefully considered, due to the degraded ability of individual sub-reservoirs at small sizes.

A reinforced learning platform is also presented in the paper to optimize the $$\\hbox {Ca}^{2+}$$ Ca 2 + activated level and time slot of input signals $$T_b$$ T b into the gate. This design platform caters for any size and connectivity of the cell population, by taking into consideration the delay and noise produced from the signalling between the cells. To validate the effectiveness of the reinforced learning platform, a $$\\hbox {Ca}^{2+}$$ Ca 2 + signalling simulator was used to simulate the signalling between the astrocyte cells. The results from the simulation show that an optimum value for both the $$\\hbox {Ca}^{2+}$$ Ca 2 + activated level and time slot of input signals $$T_b$$ T b is required to achieve up to 90% accuracy for both the AND and OR gates.

However, assessing the impact on overall cardiovascular function or predicting longer-term outcomes may requires more comprehensive whole heart CFD models. Fitting such models to patient data requires numerous computationally expensive simulations, and depends on specific clinical measurements to constrain model parameters, hampering clinical adoption. Surrogate models can help to accelerate the fitting process while accounting for the added uncertainty. We create a validated patient-specific four-chamber heart CFD model based on the Navier-Stokes-Brinkman (NSB) equations and test Gaussian Process Emulators (GPEs) as a surrogate model for performing a variance-based global sensitivity analysis (GSA). GSA identified preload as the dominant driver of flow in both the right and left side of the heart, respectively. Left-right differences were seen in terms of vascular outflow resistances, with pulmonary artery resistance having a much larger impact on flow than aortic S.

However, timing jitter can also result in an indefinite increase in the settling time of clock recovery circuits, particularly in low swing mesochronous systems. Mesochronous clock retiming circuits are required in repeaterless low swing on-chip interconnects. We first discuss how timing jitter can result in a large increase in the settling time of the clock recovery circuit. Next, the circuit is modelled as a Markov chain with absorbing states. The mean time to absorption of the Markov chain, which represents the mean settling time of the circuit, is determined. The model is validated through behavioural simulations of the circuit, the results of which match well with the model predictions. We consider circuits with (1)\u00a0data dependent jitter, (2)\u00a0random jitter, and (3) combination of both of them. We show that a mismatch between the strengths of up and down corrections of the retiming can reduce the settling time. In particular, a 10% mismatch can reduce the mean settling time by up to 40%. We leverage this fact toward improving the settling time performance, and propose useful techniques based on biased training sequences and mismatched charge pumps. We also present a coarse+fine clock retiming circuit, which can operate in coarse first mode, to reduce the settling time substantially.

Despite a substantial body of theoretical work concerning MC, the lack of practical micro/nanoscale MC devices and MC testbeds has led researchers to make overly simplifying assumptions about the implications of the channel conditions and the physical architectures of the practical transceivers in developing theoretical models and devising communication methods for MC. On the other hand, MC imposes unique challenges resulting from the highly complex, nonlinear, time-varying channel properties that cannot be always tackled by conventional information and communication tools and technologies (ICT).

Ising computing essentially tries to solve the quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem, which is also described by the Ising spin glass model and is also the basis for so-called Quantum Annealing computers. In this work, we propose a novel General Purpose Graphics Processing Unit (GPGPU) solver for the balanced min-cut graph partitioning problem, which has many applications in the area of design automation and others. Ising model solvers for the balanced min-cut partitioning problem have been proposed in the past. However, they have rarely been demonstrated in existing quantum computers for many meaningful problem sizes. One difficulty is the fact that the balancing constraint in the balanced min-cut problem can result in a complete graph in the Ising model, which makes each local update a global update. Such global update from each GPU thread will diminish the efficiency of GPU computing, which favors many localized memory accesses for each thread. To mitigate this problem, we propose an novel Global Decoupled Ising (GDI) model and the corresponding annealing algorithm, in which the local update is still preserved to maintain the efficiency. As a result, the new Ising solver essentially eliminates the need for the fully connected graph and will use a more efficient method to track and update global balance without sacrificing cut quality. Experimental results show that the proposed Ising-based min-cut partitioning method outperforms the state of art partitioning tool, METIS, on G-set graph benchmarks in terms of partitioning quality with similar CPU/GPU times.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Chase  Cook", "Wentian  Jin", "Sheldon X.-D.

Optimization is receiving increasing attention, since it is central to today\u2019s artificial intelligence. All of these optimization problems are among the hardest for human or machine to solve. It has been overlooked that physics itself does optimization in the normal evolution of dynamical systems, such as seeking out the minimum energy state. We show that among such physics principles, the idea of minimum power dissipation, also called the Principle of Minimum Entropy Generation, appears to be the most useful, since it can be readily implemented in electrical or optical circuits. Optimization is a major part of human effort. While being mathematical, optimization is also built into physics. For example, physics has the Principle of Least Action; the Principle of Minimum Power Dissipation, also called Minimum Entropy Generation; and the Variational Principle. Physics also has Physical Annealing, which, of course, preceded computational Simulated Annealing. Physics has the Adiabatic Principle, which, in its quantum form, is called Quantum Annealing. Thus, physical machines can solve the mathematical problem of optimization, including constraints. Binary constraints can be built into the physical optimization. In that case, the machines are digital in the same sense that a flip\u2013flop is digital. A wide variety of machines have had recent success at optimizing the Ising magnetic energy. We demonstrate in this paper that almost all those machines perform optimization according to the Principle of Minimum Power Dissipation as put forth by Onsager. Further, we show that this optimization is in fact equivalent to Lagrange multiplier optimization for constrained problems. We find that the physical gain coefficients that drive those systems actually play the role of the corresponding Lagrange multipliers.", "venue": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences", "authors": ["Sri Krishna Vadlamani", "Tianyao Patrick Xiao", "Eli  Yablonovitch"], "year": 2020, "n_citations": 6}

Boltzmann machines and other stochastic neural networks have been shown to outperform their deterministic counterparts by allowing dynamical systems to escape local energy minima. Electronic implementation of such stochastic networks is currently limited to addition of algorithmic noise to digital machines which is inherently inefficient; albeit recent efforts to harness physical noise in devices for stochasticity have shown promise. To succeed in fabricating electronic neuromorphic networks we need experimental evidence of devices with measurable and controllable stochasticity which is complemented with the development of reliable statistical models of such observed stochasticity. Current research literature has sparse evidence of the former and a complete lack of the latter. This motivates the current article where we demonstrate a stochastic neuron using an insulator-metal-transition (IMT) device, based on electrically induced phase-transition, in series with a tunable resistance. We show that an IMT neuron has dynamics similar to a piecewise linear FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) neuron and incorporates all characteristics of a spiking neuron in the device phenomena. We experimentally demonstrate spontaneous stochastic spiking along with electrically controllable firing probabilities using Vanadium Dioxide (VO2) based IMT neurons which show a sigmoid-like transfer function. The stochastic spiking is explained by two noise sources - thermal noise and threshold fluctuations, which act as precursors of bifurcation. As such, the IMT neuron is modeled as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process with a fluctuating boundary resulting in transfer curves that closely match experiments. The moments of interspike intervals are calculated analytically by extending the first-passage-time (FPT) models for Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process to include a fluctuating boundary. We find that the coefficient of variation of interspike intervals depend on the relative proportion of thermal and threshold noise, where threshold noise is the dominant source in the current experimental demonstrations.

They differ in their prediction of the effect on memristance of changing the electrode size and factors that affect the hysteresis. Using a batch of TiO$_2$ sol-gel memristors fabricated with different top electrode widths we test and compare these three theories. It was found that, contrary to model 2's prediction, the `dimensionless lumped parameter', $\\beta$, did not correlate to any measure of the hysteresis. Contrary to model 1, memristance was found to be dependent on the three spatial dimensions of the TiO$_2$ layer, as was predicted by model 3. Model 3 was found to fit the change in resistance value with electrode size. Simulations using model 3 and experimentally derived values for contact resistance gave hysteresis values that were linearly related to (and only one order of magnitude out) from the experimentally-measured values. Memristor hysteresis was found to be related to the ON state resistance and thus the electrode size (as those two are related).

This paper proposes a novel photonic computing system made-up of Mach-Zehnder interferometer and an optical fiber spool to emulate a powerful machine learning technique called reservoir computing. The proposed system is also integrated with a time-division-multiplexing circuit to facilitate parallel computation of multiple tasks which is first of its kind. The proposed design performs large-scale tasks like spoken digit recognition, channel equalization, and time-series prediction. Experimental results with standard photonic simulator demonstrate significant performance in terms of speed and accuracy compared to state of the art digital and software implementations.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Dharanidhar  Dang", "Rabi N.

CAMs are widely used for data-centric applications that involve pattern matching and search functionality. To accommodate the ever expanding data, it is attractive to resort to analog CAM for memory density improvement. However, the digital CAM design nowadays based on standard CMOS or emerging NVMs (e.g., resistive storage devices) is already challenging due to area, power, and cost penalties. Thus, it can be extremely expensive to achieve analog CAM with those technologies due to added cell components. As such, we propose, for the first time, a universal compact FeFET-based CAM design, FeCAM, with search and storage functionality enabled in digital and analog domains simultaneously. By exploiting the multilevel-cell (MLC) states of FeFET, FeCAM can store and search inputs in either digital or analog domain. We perform a device-circuit codesign of the proposed FeCAM and validate its functionality and performance using an experimentally calibrated FeFET model.

We explore the influence of input scale reduction on LSM instead. There are two main reasons for studying the input reduction of LSM. One is that the input dimension of large images requires efficient processing. Another one is that there exists redundancy in images which provides opportunities for compression. To mitigate the difficulty in effectively dealing with huge input spaces of LSM, and to find that whether input reduction can enhance LSM performance, we explore several input patterns, namely fullscale, scanline, chessboard, and patch. Several datasets have been used to evaluate the performance of the proposed input patterns, including two frame-based image datasets and one event-based image database.

To overcome this problem, one Reliable Energy Source (RES) can be resorted to for a prompt delivery of backlogged packets. Naturally, there exists a tradeoff between the packet delivery delay and power consumption from the RES. In this paper, we address the delay optimal scheduling problem for a bursty communication link powered by a capacity-limited battery storing harvested energy together with one RES. The proposed scheduling scheme gives priority to the usage of harvested energy, and resorts to the RES when necessary based on the data and energy queueing processes, with an average power constraint from the RES.

This may partially be due to the fact that controlling an MC system at microscale is challenging. To link the macroworld to the microworld, we propose and demonstrate a biological signal conversion interface that can also be seen as a microscale modulator. In particular, the proposed interface transduces an optical signal, which is controlled using a light-emitting diode, into a chemical signal by changing the pH of the environment. The modulator is realized using Escherichia coli bacteria as microscale entity expressing the light-driven proton pump gloeorhodopsin from Gloeobacter violaceus. Upon inducing external light stimuli, these bacteria locally change their surrounding pH level by exporting protons into the environment. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed optical-to-chemical signal converter, we analyze the pH signal measured by a pH sensor, which serves as a receiver. We develop an analytical parametric model for the induced chemical signal as a function of the applied optical signal. Using this model, we derive a training-based channel estimator that estimates the parameters of the proposed model to fit the measurement data based on a least square error approach. We further derive the optimal maximum likelihood detector and a suboptimal low-complexity detector to recover the transmitted data from the measured received signal. It is shown that the proposed parametric model is in good agreement with the measurement data. Moreover, for an example scenario, we show that the proposed setup is able to successfully convert an optical signal representing a sequence of binary symbols into a chemical signal with a bit rate of 1 bit/min and recover the transmitted data from the chemical signal using the proposed estimation and detection schemes.

One way of overcoming limited connectivity is to insert swaps in the circuit so that logical operations can be performed on physically adjacent qubits, which we refer to as solving the `routing via matchings' problem. We address the routing problem for families of quantum circuits defined by a hypergraph wherein each hyperedge corresponds to a potential gate. Our main result is that any unordered set of $k$-qubit gates on distinct $k$-qubit subsets of $n$ logical qubits can be ordered and parallelized in $O(n^{k-1})$ depth using a linear arrangement of $n$ physical qubits; the construction is completely general and achieves optimal scaling in the case where gates acting on all $\\binom{n}{k}$ sets of $k$ qubits are desired. We highlight two classes of problems for which our method is particularly useful. First, it applies to sets of mutually commuting gates, as in the (diagonal) phase separators of Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm) circuits. For example, a single level of a QAOA circuit for Maximum Cut can be implemented in linear depth, and a single level for $3$-SAT in quadratic depth. Second, it applies to sets of gates that do not commute but for which compilation efficiency is the dominant criterion in their ordering. In particular, it can be adapted to Trotterized time-evolution of fermionic Hamiltonians under the Jordan-Wigner transformation, and also to non-standard mixers in QAOA. Using our method, a single Trotter step of the electronic structure Hamiltonian in an arbitrary basis of $n$ orbitals can be done in $O(n^3)$ depth while a Trotter step of the unitary coupled cluster singles and doubles method can be implemented in $O(n^2 \\eta)$ depth, where $\\eta$ is the number of electrons.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Bryan  O'Gorman", "William J.

In this paper, we investigate diffusion-based spherical matrix-type drug carriers, which are employed in practice.

The motivation for studying these MC systems is that they can realize the concept of constructive and destructive signal superposition, which leads to favorable properties, such as inter-symbol interference (ISI) reduction and avoiding environmental contamination due to continuous release of signaling molecules into the channel. This paper first presents a general formulation for binary modulation schemes that employ two types of signaling molecules and proposes several modulation schemes as special cases. Moreover, two types of receivers are considered: 1) a receiver that is able to observe both types of signaling molecules (2TM) and 2) a simpler receiver that can observe only one type of signaling molecules (1TM). For both of these receivers, the maximum likelihood (ML) detector for general binary modulation is derived under the assumption that the detector has perfect knowledge of the ISI-causing sequence. The performance of this genie-aided ML detector yields an upper bound on the performance of any practical detector. In addition, two suboptimal detectors of different complexity are proposed, namely, an ML-based detector that employs an estimate of the ISI-causing sequence and a detector that neglects the effect of ISI. The proposed detectors, except for the detector that neglects ISI for the 2TM receiver, require knowledge of the channel response (CR) of the considered MC system. Moreover, the CR is needed for performance evaluation of all proposed detectors. However, deriving the CR of MC systems with reactive signaling molecules is challenging since the underlying partial differential equations that describe the reaction\u2013diffusion mechanism are coupled and non-linear. Therefore, we develop an algorithm for efficient computation of the CR and validate its accuracy via particle-based simulation. Simulation results obtained using this CR computation algorithm confirm the effectiveness of the proposed modulation and detection schemes.

It promises to dramatically speed-up many chemical, financial, cryptographical, and machine-learning applications. However, in order to capitalize on those promises, complex design flows composed of steps, such as compilation, decomposition, mapping, or transpilation need to be employed before being able to execute a conceptual quantum algorithm on an actual device. This results in many descriptions at various levels of abstraction which may significantly differ from each other. The complexity of the underlying design problems makes it ever more important to not only provide efficient solutions for the single steps but also to verify that the originally intended functionality is preserved throughout all levels of abstraction. This motivates methods for equivalence checking of quantum circuits. However, most existing methods for this are inspired by equivalence checking in the classical realm and have merely been extended to support quantum circuits (i.e., circuits which do not only rely on 0\u2019s and 1\u2019s but also employ superposition and entanglement). In this work, we propose an advanced methodology that takes the different paradigms of quantum circuits not only as a burden but as an opportunity. In fact, the proposed methodology explicitly utilizes characteristics unique to quantum computing in order to overcome the shortcomings of existing approaches. We show that by exploiting the reversibility of quantum circuits, complexity can be kept feasible in many cases. Moreover, we show that, in contrast to the classical realm, simulation is very powerful in verifying quantum circuits.

However, traditional nanophotonics options face limitations such as large device footprints compared with electronics, higher static power due to continuous laser operation, and an upper limit on achievable data rates due to large device capacitances. Nanoplasmonics is an emerging technology that has the potential for providing transformative gains on multiple metrics due to its potential to increase the light-matter interaction. In this paper, we propose and analyze a hybrid opto-electric NoC that incorporates Hybrid Plasmonics Photonics Interconnect (HyPPI), an optical interconnect that combines photonics with plasmonics. We explore various opto-electronic network hybridization options by augmenting a mesh network with HyPPI links, and compare them with the equivalent options afforded by conventional nanophotonics as well as pure electronics. Our design space exploration indicates that augmenting an electronic NoC with HyPPI gives a performance to cost ratio improvement of up to 1.8\u00d7. To further validate our estimates, we conduct trace based simulations using the NAS Parallel Benchmark suite. These benchmarks show latency improvements up to 1.64\u00d7, with negligible energy increase.

Indeed, imperfections are major obstacles in the path of further progress and ultimate commercialization of these technologies. Hence, a practically viable approach should be developed to deal with these nonidealities and unleash the full potential of nonvolatile memories in neuromorphic systems.

The task is, for a given n-bit substitution map Pn : {0, 1}n \u2192 {0, 1}n, to find a sequence of reversible logic gates that implements the map. The gate library adopted in this work consists of multiple-controlled Toffoli gates denoted by CmX , where m is the number of control bits that ranges from 0 to n \u2212 1. Controlled gates with large m (> 2) are then further decomposed into CX , CX , and CX gates. A primary concern in designing the algorithm is to reduce the use of CX gate (also known as Toffoli gate) which is known to be universal [31]. The main idea is to view an n-bit substitution map as a rank-2n tensor and to transform it such that the resulting map can be written as a tensor product of a rank-(2n\u2212 2) tensor and the 2 \u00d7 2 identity matrix. Let Pn be a set of all n-bit substitution maps. What we try to find is a size reduction map Ared : Pn \u2192 {Pn : Pn = Pn\u22121\u2297 I2}. One can see that the output Pn\u22121\u2297 I2 acts nontrivially on n\u2212 1 bits only, meaning that the map to be synthesized becomes Pn\u22121. The size reduction process is iteratively applied until it reaches tensor product of only 2\u00d7 2 matrices. Time complexity of the algorithm is exponential in n as most previously known algorithms for reversible logic synthesis also are, but it terminates within reasonable time for not too large n which may find practical uses. As stated earlier, our primary concern is the number of Toffoli gates in the output circuit, not the time complexity of the algorithm. Benchmark results show that the circuits obtained in this work outperform that of the previously reported ones in two widely known cost metrics for hard benchmark functions (URF, nthPrime) suggested in [24, 17].

This optimization serves two purposes: from a practical perspective, it can lead to a performance improvement; from a theoretical one, it leads to a novel interpretation of the actual nature of this step. This step is a reflection, which is realized by (a) cancelling the superposition of a general state to revert to the original all-zeros state, (b) flipping the sign of the amplitude of the all-zeros state, and finally (c) reverting back to the superposition state.

The authors claim that this device can solve the SSP in polynomial time using polynomial space, in principle, and observe no exponential scaling in resource requirements. We point out that (a) the properties ascribed by the authors to their device are insufficient to solve NPcomplete problems in poly-time, (b) runtime analysis offered does not cover the spectral measurement step, (c) the overall technique requires exponentially increasing resources when scaled up because of the spectral measurement step. 1. The paper reports a physical device and claims that this device solves a particular NP-complete problem using only polynomial time and space. The idea is elegant - n input parameters are entered as frequencies of periodic signals, and combined in such a way that the spectrum of the system represents partial and full sums of those parameters. Rather than iterate through this exponentially-sized spectrum, the authors develop a direct check if a particular value appears there. This solves the Subset-Sum Problem - checking a particular value can be presented by adding up some of the provided values. The operation of the device is illustrated on small examples n = 4,5,6, and the results are credible. The principle of operation is simple enough not to require mathematical proofs. The authors are careful enough to point out that their work does not imply that P=NP because the proposed machine is more appropriately modeled by a non-deterministic Turing machine, so it is hardly surprising that it solves NP-complete problems.

However, scaling to sub-20nm technologies is proving to be challenging as MOSFETs are reaching their fundamental limits and interconnection bottleneck is dominating IC operational power and performance. Migrating to 3-D, as a way to advance scaling, has eluded us due to inherent customization and manufacturing requirements in CMOS that are incompatible with 3-D organization. Partial attempts with die-die and layer-layer stacking have their own limitations. We propose a 3-D IC fabric technology, Skybridge[TM], which offers paradigm shift in technology scaling as well as design. We co-architect Skybridge's core aspects, from device to circuit style, connectivity, thermal management, and manufacturing pathway in a 3-D fabric-centric manner, building on a uniform 3-D template. Our extensive bottom-up simulations, accounting for detailed material system structures, manufacturing process, device, and circuit parasitics, carried through for several designs including a designed microprocessor, reveal a 30-60x density, 3.5x performance per watt benefits, and 10X reduction in interconnect lengths vs. scaled 16-nm CMOS.

While there are common mathematical models for neurons, which can be realized as nonlinear oscillating circuits, an electrical representation of the synaptic coupling between those is more challenging. Since this coupling strength depends on the learning procedure in the past, it should include a kind of memory. We believe that memristive devices, which are essentially nonlinear resistors with memory, are potential candidates for replacing synapses in neuromorphic circuits. Due to a huge number of synapses in a complex neuromorphic circuit, pre-investigations based on simulations of such systems can be very inefficient and time-consuming. Flexible and real-time capable memristive emulators, which can directly be incorporated into real circuits, can overcome this problem. In our approach, we introduce a generic memristive emulator based on wave digital principles. The proposed emulator is flexible, robust, efficient, and it preserves the passivity of the real device. This, in turn, also makes it reusable independent of a particular application.

To that end, emerging photonic NoCs (PNoC) are seen as a potential solution to improve the energy-efficiency (performance per watt) of on-chip communication. However, existing PNoC designs cannot realize their full potential due to their excessive laser power consumption. Prior works that attempt to improve laser power efficiency in PNoCs do not consider all key factors that affect the laser power requirement of PNoCs. Therefore, they cannot yield the desired balance between the reduction in laser power, achieved performance and energy-efficiency in PNoCs. In this paper, we present PROTEUS framework that employs rule-based self-adaptation in PNoCs.

When multiple instructions are executed in parallel, crosstalk between the instructions can corrupt the quantum state and lead to incorrect program execution. Our goal is to mitigate the application impact of crosstalk noise through software techniques. This requires (i) accurate characterization of hardware crosstalk, and (ii) intelligent instruction scheduling to serialize the affected operations. Since crosstalk characterization is computationally expensive, we develop optimizations which reduce the characterization overhead. On 3 20-qubit IBMQ systems, we demonstrate two orders of magnitude reduction in characterization time (compute time on the QC device) compared to all-pairs crosstalk measurements. Informed by these characterization, we develop a scheduler that judiciously serializes high crosstalk instructions balancing the need to mitigate crosstalk and exponential decoherence errors from serialization. On real-system runs on 3 IBMQ systems, our scheduler improves the error rate of application circuits by up to 5.6x, compared to the IBM instruction scheduler and offers near-optimal crosstalk mitigation in practice.

Therefore, memristor-CMOS logic is a promising fit for peripheral I/O logic in active matrix displays. In this paper, we design and implement a ternary 1-3 line decoder and a ternary 2-9 line decoder which are used to program a seven segment LED display.

Second, an intermediate representation is introduced that allows to trace data dependencies within the program, allowing to clean up qubits early. This realizes an analog to \"garbage collection\" for reversible circuits.

In this paper, we propose the use of photolysis reactions, which use the light to instantly transform the emitted molecules so they are no longer recognized after their detection. The light is emitted at an optimal time, allowing the receiver to detect as many molecules as possible, which increases both the signal strength and ISI mitigation.

The leading candidate task for this milestone entails sampling from the output distribution defined by a random quantum circuit. We develop a massively-parallel simulation tool Rollright that does not require inter-process communication (IPC) or proprietary hardware. We also develop two ways to trade circuit fidelity for computational speedups, so as to match the fidelity of a given quantum computer --- a task previously thought impossible. We report massive speedups for the sampling task over prior software from Microsoft, IBM, Alibaba and Google, as well as supercomputer and GPU-based simulations. By using publicly available Google Cloud Computing, we price such simulations and enable comparisons by total cost across hardware platforms. We simulate approximate sampling from the output of a circuit with 7x8 qubits and depth 1+40+1 by producing one million bitstring probabilities with fidelity 0.5%, at an estimated cost of $35184. The simulation costs scale linearly with fidelity, and using this scaling we estimate that extending circuit depth to 1+48+1 increases costs to one million dollars.

In 2016, the successful fabrication and testing of AQFP-based circuits with the scale of 83,000 JJs have demonstrated the scalability and potential of implementing large-scale systems using AQFP. As a result, it will be promising for AQFP in high-performance computing and deep space applications, with Deep Neural Network (DNN) inference acceleration as an important example. Besides ultra-high energy efficiency, AQFP exhibits two unique characteristics: the deep pipelining nature since each AQFP logic gate is connected with an AC clock signal, which increases the difficulty to avoid RAW hazards; the second is the unique opportunity of true random number generation (RNG) using a single AQFP buffer, far more efficient than RNG in CMOS. We point out that these two characteristics make AQFP especially compatible with the stochastic computing (SC) technique, which uses a time-independent bit sequence for value representation, and is compatible with the deep pipelining nature. Further, the application of SC has been investigated in DNNs in prior work, and the suitability has been illustrated as SC is more compatible with approximate computations. This work is the first to develop an SC-based DNN acceleration framework using AQFP technology. The deep-pipelining nature of AQFP circuits translates into the difficulty in designing accumulators/counters in AQFP, which makes the prior design in SC-based DNN not suitable. We overcome this limitation taking into account different properties in CONV and FC layers: (i) the inner product calculation in FC layers has more number of inputs than that in CONV layers; (ii) accurate activation function is critical in CONV rather than FC layers. Based on these observations, we propose (i) accurate integration of summation and activation function in CONV layers using bitonic sorting network and feedback loop, and (ii) low-complexity categorization block for FC layers based on chain of majority gates. For complete design we also develop (i) ultra-efficient stochastic number generator in AQFP, (ii) a high-accuracy sub-sampling (pooling) block in AQFP, and (iii) majority synthesis for further performance improvement and automatic buffer/splitter insertion for requirement of AQFP circuits.

In Physarum, predictable morphological adaptation is prevented by its adhesion to the underlying substrate. We investigate what possible computations could be achieved if these limitations were removed and the organism was free to completely adapt its morphology in response to changing stimuli. Using a particle model of Physarum displaying emergent morphological adaptation behaviour, we demonstrate how a minimal approach to collective material computation may be used to transform and summarise properties of spatially represented datasets. We find that the virtual material relaxes more strongly to high-frequency changes in data, which can be used for the smoothing (or filtering) of data by approximating moving average and low-pass filters in 1D datasets. The relaxation and minimisation properties of the model enable the spatial computation of B-spline curves (approximating splines) in 2D datasets. Both clamped and unclamped spline curves of open and closed shapes can be represented, and the degree of spline curvature corresponds to the relaxation time of the material. The material computation of spline curves also includes novel quasi-mechanical properties, including unwinding of the shape between control points and a preferential adhesion to longer, straighter paths. Interpolating splines could not directly be approximated due to the formation and evolution of Steiner points at narrow vertices, but were approximated after rectilinear pre-processing of the source data. This pre-processing was further simplified by transforming the original data to contain the material inside the polyline. These exemplary results expand the repertoire of spatially represented unconventional computing devices by demonstrating a simple, collective and distributed approach to data and curve smoothing.", "venue": "Bioinspiration & biomimetics", "authors": ["Jeff  Jones", "Andrew  Adamatzky"], "year": 2014, "n_citations": 18}

It is responsible for relaying information from one neuron to another, but also provides support for complex functionalities, such as learning and memory.

In particular, some synapses feature a re-uptake mechanism at the presynaptic neuron, which provides a means for removing neurotransmitters from the synaptic cleft and for recycling them for future reuse. In this paper, we develop a comprehensive channel model for synaptic DMC encompassing a spatial model of the synaptic cleft, molecule re-uptake at the presynaptic neuron, and reversible binding to individual receptors at the postsynaptic neuron. Based on this model, we derive an analytical time domain expression for the channel impulse response (CIR) of the synaptic DMC system. Our model explicitly incorporates macroscopic physical channel parameters and can be used to evaluate the impact of re-uptake, receptor density, and channel width on the CIR of the synaptic DMC system.

In this paper, we propose the first architectural synthesis framework considering distributed storage constructed temporarily from transportation channels to cache fluid samples. Since distributed storage can be accessed more efficiently than a dedicated storage unit and channels can switch between the roles of transportation and storage easily, biochips with this distributed computing architecture can achieve a higher execution efficiency even with fewer resources. Experimental results confirm that the execution efficiency of a bioassay can be improved by up to 28% while the number of valves in the biochip can be reduced effectively.", "venue": "2017 54th ACM/EDAC/IEEE Design Automation Conference (DAC)", "authors": ["Chunfeng  Liu", "Bing  Li", "Hailong  Yao", "Paul  Pop", "Tsung-Yi  Ho", "Ulf  Schlichtmann"], "year": 2017, "n_citations": 26}

A challenging engineering goal is to design a few molecules so that large numbers of them can self-assemble into desired complicated target objects. Indeed, we would like to understand the ultimate capabilities and limitations of this bottom-up fabrication process. We look to theoretical models of algorithmic self-assembly, where small square tiles stick together according to simple local rules in order to carry out a crystal growth process. In this survey, we focus on the use of simulation between such models to classify and separate their computational and expressive powers. Roughly speaking, one model simulates another if they grow the same structures, via the same dynamical growth processes. Our journey begins with the result that there is a single intrinsically universal tile set that, with appropriate initialization and spatial scaling, simulates any instance of Winfree's abstract Tile Assembly Model. This universal tile set exhibits something stronger than Turing universality: it captures the geometry and dynamics of any simulated system in a very direct way. From there we find that there is no such tile set in the more restrictive non-cooperative model, proving it weaker than the full Tile Assembly Model. In the two-handed model, where large structures can bind together in one step, we encounter an infinite set of infinite hierarchies of strictly increasing simulation power. Towards the end of our trip, we find one tile to rule them all: a single rotatable flipable polygonal tile that simulates any tile assembly system. We find another tile that aperiodically tiles the plane (but with small gaps). These and other recent results show that simulation is giving rise to a kind of computational complexity theory for self-assembly.

An analogous result holds also on non-binary logic: For any finite set A, a finite set of reversible gates can generate all even permutations of A n for all n. This means that a finite gate set can generate all permutations of A n when the cardinality of A is odd, and that one auxiliary \u201cborrowed\u201d symbol is necessary and sufficient to obtain all permutations when the cardinality of A is even. We consider the conservative case, that is, those permutations of A n that preserve the weight of the input word. The weight is the vector that records how many times each symbol occurs in the word or, more generally, the image of the word under a fixed monoid homomorphism from A \u204e to a commutative monoid. It turns out that no finite conservative gate set can, for all n, implement all conservative even permutations of A n without borrowed symbols.

Due to their aggressive power management schemes, it is a common and necessary technique to make a back-up of their program states and other necessary data in a non-volatile memory (NVM) before going to sleep or low power mode. However, this memory is often left unprotected as adding robust security measures tends to be expensive for these resource constrained systems. In this paper, we propose a lightweight security system for NVM during low power mode. This security architecture uses the memristor, an emerging nanoscale device which is used to build hardware security primitives like PUF (physical unclonable function) based encryption-decryption, true random number generators (TRNG), and memory integrity checking. A reliability enhancement technique for this PUF is also proposed which shows how this system would work even with less-than-100\\% reliable PUF responses. Together, with all these techniques, we have established a dual layer security protocol (data encryption+integrity check) which provides reasonable security to an embedded processor while being very lightweight in terms of area, power, and computation time.

Possible arrangement of such devices in a crosspoint architecture can pave the way for ultra-dense neural networks.

Several algorithms are available that attempt to explore the solution space of this class efficiently, while requiring a reasonable compute time. However, although these algorithms have reached various degrees of success over the years, they still face considerable challenges when confronted with particularly hard problem instances, such as those of the MIPLIB 2010 library. In this work we propose a radically different non-algorithmic approach to ILP based on a novel physics-inspired computing paradigm: Memcomputing. This paradigm is based on digital (hence scalable) machines represented by appropriate electrical circuits with memory. These machines can be either built in hardware or, as we do here, their equations of motion can be efficiently simulated on our traditional computers. We first describe a new circuit architecture of memcomputing machines specifically designed to solve for the linear inequalities representing a general ILP problem. We call these self-organizing algebraic circuits, since they self-organize dynamically to satisfy the correct (algebraic) linear inequalities. We then show simulations of these machines using MATLAB running on a single core of a Xeon processor for several ILP benchmark problems taken from the MIPLIB 2010 library, and compare our results against a renowned commercial solver. We show that our approach is very efficient when dealing with these hard problems. In particular, we find within minutes feasible solutions for one of these hard problems (f2000 from MIPLIB 2010) whose feasibility, to the best of our knowledge, has remained unknown for the past eight years.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Fabio L.

Neural networks urge for parallelism across the entire processor and for a co-location of memory and arithmetic, i.e. beyond von Neumann architectures. Parallelism in particular made photonics a highly promising platform, yet until now scalable and integratable concepts are scarce. Here, we demonstrate for the first time how a fully parallel and fully implemented photonic neural network can be realized by spatially multiplexing neurons across the complex optical near-field of a semiconductor multimode laser. Discrete spatial sampling defines \u223c90 nodes on the surface of a large-area vertical cavity surface emitting laser that is optically injected with the artificial neural networks input information. Importantly, all neural network connections are realized in hardware, and our processor produces results without pre- or post-processing.

The first is a semiconductor platform based on analog CMOS circuits and waveguide-integrated photodiodes. The second is a superconducting approach that utilizes Josephson junctions and waveguide-integrated superconducting single-photon detectors. We discuss available devices, assess scaling potential, and provide a list of key metrics and demonstrations for each platform. Both platforms hold potential, but their development will diverge in important respects.

Superconducting systems place near theoretically minimum burdens on light sources (a tremendous boon to one of the most speculative aspects of either platform) and provide new opportunities for integrated, high-endurance synaptic memory.

A node updates its current state depending on states of two closest neighbours in the node chain and two closest neighbours in the complementary chain.

Recent developments in nano-technologies are making available extremely compact and low power, but also variable and unreliable solid-state devices that can potentially extend the offerings of availing CMOS technologies.

Nanometer-scale devices exploiting spin electronics (or spintronics) can be a key technology in this context.

However, the accuracy of current annealers such as the ones of D-Wave Systems, Inc., is limited by environmental noise and hardware biases. One way to deal with these imperfections and to improve the quality of the annealing results is to apply a variety of pre-processing techniques such as spin reversal (SR), anneal offsets (AO), or chain weights (CW). Maximizing the effectiveness of these techniques involves performing optimizations over a large number of parameters, which would be too costly if needed to be done for each new problem instance. In this work, we show that the aforementioned parameter optimization can be done for an entire class of problems, given each instance uses a previously chosen fixed embedding. Specifically, in the training phase, we fix an embedding E of a complete graph onto the hardware of the annealer, and then run an optimization algorithm to tune the following set of parameter values: the set of bits to be flipped for SR, the specific qubit offsets for AO, and the distribution of chain weights, optimized over a set of training graphs randomly chosen from that class, where the graphs are embedded onto the hardware using E. In the testing phase, we estimate how well the parameters computed during the training phase work on a random selection of other graphs from that class. We investigate graph instances of varying densities for the Maximum Clique, Maximum Cut, and Graph Partitioning problems.

To scale up beyond current proof-of-principle demonstrations, new methods for managing the complexity of designed molecular systems will need to be developed. Here we focus on the challenge of verifying the correctness of molecular implementations of abstract chemical reaction networks, where operation in a well-mixed \u201csoup\u201d of molecules is stochastic, asynchronous, concurrent, and often involves multiple intermediate steps in the implementation, parallel pathways, and side reactions. This problem relates to the verification of Petri nets, but existing approaches are not sufficient for providing a single guarantee covering an infinite set of possible initial states (molecule counts) and an infinite state space potentially explored by the system given any initial state. We address these issues by formulating a new theory of pathway decomposition that provides an elegant formal basis for comparing chemical reaction network implementations, and we present an algorithm that computes this basis. Our theory naturally handles certain situations that commonly arise in molecular implementations, such as what we call \u201cdelayed choice,\u201d that are not easily accommodated by other approaches. We further show how pathway decomposition can be combined with weak bisimulation to handle a wider class that includes most currently known enzyme-free DNA implementation techniques. We anticipate that our notion of logical equivalence between chemical reaction network implementations will be valuable for other molecular implementations such as biochemical enzyme systems, and perhaps even more broadly in concurrency theory.", "venue": "Theor.

Approximation of Voronoi diagrams for point data sources, complex planar shapes and circle sets is demonstrated. By altering repellent con- centration we found that partition of data sources was maintained but the internal network connectivity was minimised by the contractile force of the transport network.

There have been the conventional low-write-power but bulky SRAM-based TCAM design, and also denser but less reliable or higher-write-power TCAM designs using nonvolatile memory (NVM) devices. Meanwhile, some TCAM designs using dynamic memories have been also proposed. Although dynamic design TCAM is denser than CMOS SRAM TCAM and more reliable than NVM TCAM, the conventional row-by-row refresh operations land up with a bottleneck of interference with normal TCAM activities. Therefore, this paper proposes a custom low-power dynamic TCAM using nanoelectromechanical (NEM) relay devices utilizing one-shot refresh to solve the memory refresh problem. By harnessing the unique NEM relay characteristics with a proposed novel cell structure, the proposed TCAM occupies a small footprint of only 3 transistors (with two NEM relays integrated on the top through the back-end-of-line process), which significantly outperforms the density of 16-transistor SRAM-based TCAM.

It is currently not fully understood how this randomness impacts downstream signaling in the target cell and, ultimately, neural computation and learning. The statistical characterization of the reaction-diffusion process is difficult because the reversible bi-molecular reaction of NTs and receptors renders the system nonlinear. Consequently, existing models for the receptor occupancy in the synaptic cleft rely on simplifying assumptions and approximations which limit their practical applicability. In this work, we propose a novel statistical model for the reaction-diffusion process governing synaptic signal transmission in terms of the chemical master equation (CME). We show how to compute the CME efficiently and verify the accuracy of the obtained results with stochastic particle-based computer simulations (PBSs). Furthermore, we compare the proposed model to two benchmark models proposed in the literature and show that it provides more accurate results when compared to PBSs. Finally, the proposed model is used to study the impact of the system parameters on the statistical dependence between binding events of NTs and receptors. In summary, the proposed model provides a step forward towards a complete statistical characterization of synaptic signal transmission.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Sebastian  Lotter", "Maximilian  Schafer", "Robert  Schober"], "year": 2021, "n_citations": 0}

We present an experimental implementation of a collision gate with liquid marbles. Mechanics of the gate follows principles of Margolus' soft-sphere collision gate. Boolean values of the inputs are given by the absence (FALSE) or presence (TRUE) of a liquid marble. There are three outputs: two outputs are trajectories of undisturbed marbles (they only report TRUE when just one marble is present at one of the inputs), one output is represented by trajectories of colliding marbles (when two marbles collide they lose their horizontal momentum and fall), this output reports TRUE only when two marbles are present at inputs. Thus the gate implements AND and AND-NOT logical functions. We speculate that by merging trajectories representing AND-NOT output into a single channel one can produce a one-bit half-adder.

Nowadays, hardware solutions based on emerging nanodevices are designed to reduce the power consumption of these networks. Spintronics devices are promising for information processing because of the various neural and synaptic functionalities they offer. However, due to their low OFF/ON ratio, performing all the multiplications required for convolutions in a single step with a crossbar array of spintronic memories would cause sneak-path currents. Here we present an architecture where synaptic communications have a frequency selectivity that prevents crosstalk caused by sneak-path currents. We first demonstrate how a chain of spintronic resonators can function as synapses and make convolutions by sequentially rectifying radio-frequency signals encoding consecutive sets of inputs. We show that a parallel implementation is possible with multiple chains of spintronic resonators to avoid storing intermediate computational steps in memory. We propose two different spatial arrangements for these chains. For each of them, we explain how to tune many artificial synapses simultaneously, exploiting the synaptic weight sharing specific to convolutions. We show how information can be transmitted between convolutional layers by using spintronic oscillators as artificial microwave neurons. Finally, we simulate a network of these radio-frequency resonators and spintronic oscillators to solve the MNIST handwritten digits dataset, and obtain results comparable to software convolutional neural networks.

Multimode polymer waveguides in particular constitute an attractive technology for on-board optical interconnects, as they provide high bandwidth, offer relaxed alignment tolerances, and can be cost-effectively integrated onto standard printed circuit boards (PCBs). However, the continuing improvements in bandwidth performance of optical sources make it important to investigate approaches to develop high-bandwidth polymer waveguides. In this paper, we present dispersion studies on a graded-index (GI) waveguide in siloxane materials designed to deliver high bandwidth over a range of launch conditions. Bandwidth-length products of >70 and ~65 GHz\u00d7m are observed using a 50/125 \u03bcm multimode fibre (MMF) launch for input offsets of \u00b110 \u03bcm without and with the use of a mode mixer (MM), respectively; and enhanced values of >100 GHz\u00d7m are found under a 10\u00d7 microscope objective launch for input offsets of ~18 \u00d7 20 \u03bcm2. The large range of offsets is within the -1 dB alignment tolerances. A theoretical model is developed using the measured refractive index profile of the waveguide, and general agreement is found with experimental bandwidth measurements.

Deep generative models can model the underlying probability distribution of both the physical structures and property of drugs and relate them nonlinearly. By exploiting patterns in massive datasets, these models can distill salient features that characterize the molecules. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) discover drug candidates by generating molecular structures that obey chemical and physical properties and show affinity toward binding with the receptor for a target disease. However, classical GANs cannot explore certain regions of the chemical space and suffer from training instabilities. The practical utility of such models is limited due to the vast size of the search space, characterized by millions of parameters.

WDE occurs on the neighboring cells of a written cell due to heat dissipation. Previous studies for the prevention of WDEs are based on the write cache or verify-n-correction while they often suffer from significant area overhead and performance degradation, making it unsuitable for high-performance computing. Therefore, an on-demand correction is required to minimize the performance overhead. In this paper, an in-module disturbance barrier (IMDB) mitigating WDEs is proposed.

We present efficient circuits for ternary reversible and quantum arithmetics. Our main result is the derivation of circuits for two families of ternary quantum adders, namely ripple carry adders and carry look-ahead adders. The main difference to the binary case is the more complicated form of the ternary carry, which leads to higher resource counts for implementations over a universal ternary gate set. Our ternary ripple adder circuit has a circuit depth of $O(n)$ and uses only $1$ ancilla, making it more efficient in both, circuit depth and width than previous constructions. Our ternary carry lookahead circuit has a circuit depth of only $O(\\log\\,n)$, while using with $O(n)$ ancillas. Our approach works on two levels of abstraction: at the first level, descriptions of arithmetic circuits are given in terms of gates sequences that use various types of non-Clifford reflections. At the second level, we break down these reflections further by deriving them either from the two-qutrit Clifford gates and the non-Clifford gate $C(X): |i,j\\rangle \\mapsto |i, j + \\delta_{i,2} \\mod 3\\rangle$ or from the two-qutrit Clifford gates and the non-Clifford gate $P_9=\\mbox{diag}(e^{-2 \\pi \\, i/9},1,e^{2 \\pi \\, i/9})$. The two choices of elementary gate sets correspond to two possible mappings onto two different prospective quantum computing architectures which we call the metaplectic and the supermetaplectic basis, respectively.

It is derived from several recurrent neural network models, including echo state networks and liquid state machines. A reservoir computing system consists of a reservoir for mapping inputs into a high-dimensional space and a readout for pattern analysis from the high-dimensional states in the reservoir. The reservoir is fixed and only the readout is trained with a simple method such as linear regression and classification. Thus, the major advantage of reservoir computing compared to other recurrent neural networks is fast learning, resulting in low training cost. Another advantage is that the reservoir without adaptive updating is amenable to hardware implementation using a variety of physical systems, substrates, and devices. In fact, such physical reservoir computing has attracted increasing attention in diverse fields of research.

Unfortunately, increasing the DWDM degree (i.e., using a larger number of wavelengths) to achieve higher aggregated datarate in photonic links, and hence higher throughput in PNoCs, requires sophisticated and costly laser sources along with extra photonic hardware. This extra hardware can introduce undesired noise to the photonic link and increase the bit-error-rate (BER), power, and area consumption of PNoCs. To mitigate these issues, the use of 4-pulse amplitude modulation (4-PAM) signaling, instead of the conventional on-off keying (OOK) signaling, can halve the wavelength signals utilized in photonic links for achieving the target aggregate datarate while reducing the overhead of crosstalk noise, BER, and photonic hardware. There are various designs of 4- PAM modulators reported in the literature. For example, the signal superposition (SS), electrical digital-to-analog converter (EDAC), and optical digital-to-analog converter (ODAC) based designs of 4-PAM modulators have been reports. However, it is yet to be explored how these SS, EDAC, and ODAC based 4-PAM modulators can be utilized to design DWDM-based photonic links and PNoC architectures.

These devices are now moving out of the laboratory and becoming generally programmable. This allows identical quantum tasks or algorithms to be implemented on radically different technologies to inform further development and scaling. We run a series of algorithms on the two leading platforms: trapped atomic ions and superconducting circuits. Whereas the superconducting system offers faster gate clock speeds and a solid-state platform, the ion-trap system features superior qubits and reconfigurable connections. The performance of these systems is seen to reflect the topology of connections in the base hardware, supporting the idea that quantum computer applications and hardware should be codesigned. We run a selection of algorithms on two state-of-the-art 5-qubit quantum computers that are based on different technology platforms. One is a publicly accessible superconducting transmon device (www.research.ibm.com/ibm-q) with limited connectivity, and the other is a fully connected trapped-ion system. Even though the two systems have different native quantum interactions, both can be programed in a way that is blind to the underlying hardware, thus allowing a comparison of identical quantum algorithms between different physical systems. We show that quantum algorithms and circuits that use more connectivity clearly benefit from a better-connected system of qubits. Although the quantum systems here are not yet large enough to eclipse classical computers, this experiment exposes critical factors of scaling quantum computers, such as qubit connectivity and gate expressivity.

To realize the full potential of such a system, an in-depth understanding of the interplay between the spatial user density and inter-user interference (IUI) and its impact on system performance in an asymptotic regime with large numbers of users is needed. In this paper, we adopt a three-dimensional (3-D) system model with multiple independent and spatially distributed point-to-point transmission links, where both the TXs and RXs are positioned according to a regular hexagonal grid, respectively. Based on this model, we first derive an expression for the channel impulse responses (CIRs) of all TX-RX links in the system. Then, we provide the maximum likelihood (ML) decision rule for the RXs and show that it reduces to a threshold-based detector. We derive an analytical expression for the corresponding detection threshold which depends on the statistics of the MC channel and the statistics of the IUI. Furthermore, we derive an analytical expression for the bit error rate (BER) and the achievable rate of a single transmission link.

The discontinuity can be described as a Heaviside function, $H$, located on $w$, for which there are three common single-valued approximations for $H(w)$.

This paper is the first, to the best of our knowledge, to characterize the thermal behavior of HMC in a real environment using the AC-510 accelerator and to identify temperature as a new limitation for this state-of-the-art design space. Moreover, besides bandwidth studies, we deconstruct factors that contribute to latency and reveal their sources for high- and low-load accesses. The results of this paper demonstrates essential behaviors and performance bottlenecks for future explorations of packet-switched and 3D-stacked memories.", "venue": "2017 IEEE International Symposium on Workload Characterization (IISWC)", "authors": ["Ramyad  Hadidi", "Bahar  Asgari", "Burhan Ahmad Mudassar", "Saibal  Mukhopadhyay", "Sudhakar  Yalamanchili", "Hyesoon  Kim"], "year": 2017, "n_citations": 37}

While the integration density, memory property, and nonlinear characteristics have many benefits, reducing the energy consumption is limited by the resistive nature of the devices. Memcapacitors would address that limitation while still having all the benefits of memristors. Recent work has shown that with adjusted parameters during the fabrication process, a metal-oxide device can indeed exhibit a memcapacitive behavior. We introduce novel memcapacitive logic gates and memcapacitive crossbar classifiers as a proof of concept that such applications can outperform memristor-based architectures. The results illustrate that, compared to memristive logic gates, our memcapacitive gates consume about 7x less power. The memcapacitive crossbar classifier achieves similar classification performance but reduces the power consumption by a factor of about 1,500x for the MNIST dataset and a factor of about 1,000x for the CIFAR-10 dataset compared to a memristive crossbar.

SNN-based machine-learning programs are typically executed on tilebased neuromorphic hardware platforms, where each tile consists of a computation unit called crossbar, which maps neurons and synapses of the program. However, synthesizing such programs on an off-the-shelf neuromorphic hardware is challenging. This is because of the inherent resource and latency limitations of the hardware, which impact both model performance, e.g., accuracy, and hardware performance, e.g., throughput. We propose DFSynthesizer, an end-to-end framework for synthesizing SNN-based machine learning programs to neuromorphic hardware. The proposed framework works in four steps. First, it analyzes a machine-learning program and generates SNN workload using representative data. Second, it partitions the SNN workload and generates clusters that fit on crossbars of the target neuromorphic hardware. Third, it exploits the rich semantics of Synchronous Dataflow Graph (SDFG) to represent a clustered SNN program, allowing for performance analysis in terms of key hardware constraints such as number of crossbars, dimension of each crossbar, buffer space on tiles, and tile communication bandwidth. Finally, it uses a novel scheduling algorithm to execute clusters on crossbars of the hardware, guaranteeing hardware performance.

This is in part due to their nonlinear dynamics, and a strong dependence on the circuit topology. We provide evidence that also purely memristive circuits can be employed for computational purposes. In the present paper we show that a polynomial Lyapunov function in the memory parameters exists for the case of DC controlled memristors. Such a Lyapunov function can be asymptotically approximated with binary variables, and mapped to quadratic combinatorial optimization problems. This also shows a direct parallel between memristive circuits and the Hopfield-Little model. In the case of Erdos-Renyi random circuits, we show numerically that the distribution of the matrix elements of the projectors can be roughly approximated with a Gaussian distribution, and that it scales with the inverse square root of the number of elements. This provides an approximated but direct connection with the physics of disordered system and, in particular, of mean field spin glasses. Using this and the fact that the interaction is controlled by a projector operator on the loop space of the circuit.

A DMM then finds the solution via a succession of elementary instantons whose role is to eliminate solitonic configurations of logical inconsistency (\"logical defects\") from the circuit. By employing a supersymmetric theory of dynamics, a DMM can be described by a cohomological field theory that allows for computation of certain topological matrix elements on instantons that have the mathematical meaning of intersection numbers on instantons.

However, a key challenge with resistive crossbars is that they suffer from a range of device and circuit level nonidealities, such as driver resistance, sensing resistance, sneak paths, interconnect parasitics, nonlinearities in the peripheral circuits, stochastic write operations, and process variations. These nonidealities can lead to errors in VMMs, eventually degrading the DNN\u2019s accuracy. It is therefore critical to study the impact of crossbar nonidealities on the accuracy of large-scale DNNs (with millions of neurons and billions of synaptic connections). However, this is challenging because the existing device and circuit models are too slow to use in application-level evaluations. We present RxNN, a fast and accurate simulation framework to evaluate large-scale DNNs on resistive crossbar systems. RxNN splits and maps the computations involved in each DNN layer into crossbar operations, and evaluates them using a fast crossbar model (FCM) that accurately captures the errors arising due to crossbar nonidealities while being four-to-five orders of magnitude faster than circuit simulation. FCM models a crossbar-based VMM operation using three stages\u2014nonlinear models for the input and output peripheral circuits (digital-to-analog and analog-to-digital converters), and an equivalent nonideal conductance matrix for the core crossbar array.

However training spiking RNNs on dedicated neuromorphic hardware is still an open challenge. This is due mainly to the lack of local, hardware-friendly learning mechanisms that can solve the temporal credit assignment problem and ensure stable network dynamics, even when the weight resolution is limited. These challenges are further accentuated, if one resorts to using memristive devices for in-memory computing to resolve the von-Neumann bottleneck problem, at the expense of a substantial increase in variability in both the computation and the working memory of the spiking RNNs. To address these challenges and enable online learning in memristive neuromorphic RNNs, we present a simulation framework of differential-architecture crossbar arrays based on an accurate and comprehensive Phase Change Memory (PCM) device model. We train a spiking RNN whose weights are emulated in the presented simulation framework, using a recently proposed e-prop learning rule. Although e-prop locally approximates the ideal synaptic updates, it is difficult to implement the updates on the memristive substrate due to substantial PCM non-idealities.

It is reported, however, that the bit error rate of RRAMs can be up to 3.3% in the ultra low-power setting, which might be crucial for many use cases. Binary neural networks (BNNs), a resource efficient variant of neural networks (NNs), can tolerate a certain percentage of errors without a loss in accuracy and demand lower resources in computation and storage. The bit error tolerance (BET) in BNNs can be achieved by flipping the weight signs during training, as proposed by Hirtzlin et al., but their method has a significant drawback, especially for fully connected neural networks (FCNN): The FCNNs overfit to the error rate used in training, which leads to low accuracy under lower error rates. In addition, the underlying principles of BET are not investigated. In this work, we improve the training for BET of BNNs and aim to explain this property. We propose straight-through gradient approximation to improve the weight-sign-flip training, by which BNNs adapt less to the bit error rates. To explain the achieved robustness, we define a metric that aims to measure BET without fault injection. We evaluate the metric and find that it correlates with accuracy over error rate for all FCNNs tested.

However, the differential equation describing a diffusion-reaction process is non-linear. This precludes the possibility of using Fourier transform tools.

The optimisation of the loss performance of these complex waveguide layouts becomes particularly important at high data rates (>=25 Gb/s) due to the associated stringent power budget requirements. Moreover, launch conditions have to be carefully considered in such systems due to the highly-multimoded nature of this waveguide technology.

The performance of these components is experimentally investigated under different launch conditions for different waveguide profiles that can be readily achieved through fabrication. Useful design rules on the use of waveguide bends and crossings are derived for each waveguide type.

Due to some of the biological properties, bacteria have been proposed as a possible information carrier for molecular communication, and the corresponding communication networks are known as bacterial nanonetworks. The biological properties include the ability for bacteria to mobilize between locations and carry the information encoded in deoxyribonucleic acid molecules. However, similar to most organisms, bacteria have complex social properties that govern their colony. These social characteristics enable the bacteria to evolve through various fluctuating environmental conditions by utilizing cooperative and non-cooperative behaviors. This article provides an overview of the different types of cooperative and non-cooperative social behavior of bacteria. The challenges (due to non-cooperation) and the opportunities (due to cooperation) these behaviors can bring to the reliability of communication in bacterial nanonetworks are also discussed.

The working principle of these systems relies on the ability of currents and voltages of the circuit to self-organize in order to satisfy mathematical relations. In particular for this work, we discuss self-organizing gates, namely Self-Organizing Algebraic Gates (SOAGs), aimed to solve linear inequalities and therefore used to solve optimization problems in Integer Linear Programming (ILP) format. Unlike conventional IOgates, SOAGs are terminal-agnostic, meaning each terminal handles a superposition of input and output signals. When appropriately assembled to represent a given ILP problem, the corresponding self-organizing circuit converges to the equilibria that express the solutions to the problem at hand. Because DMM's components are non-quantum, the ordinary differential equations describing it can be efficiently simulated on our modern computers in software, as well as be built in hardware with off-of-the-shelf technology.

The high-level circuit defining the simulation needs to be transformed into one that compiles with hardware limitations such as qubit connectivity and hardware gate set. Many techniques have been developed to efficiently compile quantum circuits while minimizing compilation overhead. However, general-purpose quantum compilers work at the gate level and have little knowledge of the mathematical properties of quantum applications, missing further optimization opportunities. In this work, we exploit one application-level property in Hamiltonian simulation, which is, the flexibility of permuting different operators in the Hamiltonian (no matter whether they commute). Conventional compilation techniques may not be directly adapted to this flexibility because changing the order of anti-commuting gates violates program semantics. We develop a compiler, named 2QAN, to optimize quantum circuits for 2-local qubit Hamiltonian simulation problems, a framework which includes the important quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). In particular, we propose permutation-aware qubit mapping, qubit routing, gate optimization and scheduling techniques to minimize the compilation overhead. We evaluate 2QAN by compiling three applications (up to 50 qubits) onto three quantum computers that have different qubit topologies and hardware two-qubit gates, namely, Google Sycamore, IBMQ Montreal and Rigetti Aspen. Compared to state-of-the-art quantum compilers, 2QAN can reduce the number of inserted SWAP gates by up to 11.5X, reduce overhead in hardware gate count by up to 30.7X, and reduce overhead in circuit depth by up to 21X.

Since its introduction (SPAA 2014), a growing body of literature has adapted its assumptions for a variety of problems; however, without a standardized hierarchy of assumptions, precise systematic comparison of results under the amoebot model is difficult. We propose the canonical amoebot model, an updated formalization that distinguishes between core model features and families of assumption variants. A key improvement addressed by the canonical amoebot model is concurrency. Much of the existing literature implicitly assumes amoebot actions are isolated and reliable, reducing analysis to the sequential setting where at most one amoebot is active at a time. However, real programmable matter systems are concurrent. The canonical amoebot model formalizes all amoebot communication as message passing, leveraging adversarial activation models of concurrent executions. Under this granular treatment of time, we take two complementary approaches to concurrent algorithm design. Using hexagon formation as a case study, we first establish a set of sufficient conditions for algorithm correctness under any concurrent execution, embedding concurrency control directly in algorithm design. We then present a concurrency control framework that uses locks to convert amoebot algorithms that terminate in the sequential setting and satisfy certain conventions into algorithms that exhibit equivalent behavior in the concurrent setting. Together, the canonical amoebot model and these complementary approaches to concurrent algorithm design open new directions for distributed computing research on programmable matter. 2012 ACM Subject Classification Theory of computation \u2192 Distributed computing models; Theory of computation \u2192 Concurrency; Theory of computation \u2192 Self-organization", "venue": "DISC", "authors": ["Joshua J.

Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJ) built using LBM's as free layers can be combined with standard NMOS transistors to provide three-terminal building blocks for large scale probabilistic circuits that can be designed to perform useful functions. Interestingly, this three-terminal unit looks just like the 1T/MTJ device used in embedded MRAM technology, with only one difference: the use of an LBM for the MTJ free layer. We hope that the concept of p-bits and p-circuits will help open up new application spaces for this emerging technology. However, a p-bit need not involve an MTJ, any fluctuating resistor could be combined with a transistor to implement it, while completely digital implementations using conventional CMOS technology are also possible.

In fact, the proposed protocol is connection-oriented and uses the TCP-like probing to find a suitable transmission rate between the transmitter and the receiver to avoid receiver congestion. Unlike the TCP, however, explicit acknowledgments are not used since they would degrade the communication throughput due to the large delay, which is a characteristic feature of molecular communications. Thus, the proposed protocol uses implicit acknowledgments, and feedback signals are sent by the receiver to throttle the transmission rate at the transmitter, i.e., explicit negative feedback. We also present the results of an extensive simulation campaign, used to validate the proposed protocol and to properly dimension the main protocol parameters.", "venue": "IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications", "authors": ["Luca  Felicetti", "Mauro  Femminella", "Gianluca  Reali", "Tadashi  Nakano", "Athanasios V.

Often referred to as \u201ctemperature-2\u201d systems, those which employ cooperation are known to be quite powerful (i.e. they are computationally universal and can build an enormous variety of shapes and structures). Conversely, aTAM systems which do not enforce cooperative behavior, a.k.a. \u201ctemperature-1\u201d systems, are conjectured to be relatively very weak, likely to be unable to perform complex computations or algorithmically direct the process of self-assembly. Nonetheless, a variety of models based on slight modifications to the aTAM have been developed in which temperature-1 systems are in fact capable of Turing universal computation through a restricted notion of cooperation. Despite that power, though, several of those models have previously been proven to be unable to perform or simulate the stronger form of cooperation exhibited by temperature-2 aTAM systems. In this paper, we first prove that another model in which temperature-1 systems are computationally universal, namely the restricted glue TAM (rgTAM) in which tiles are allowed to have edges which exhibit repulsive forces, is also unable to simulate the strongly cooperative behavior of the temperature-2 aTAM. We then show that by combining the properties of two such models, the Dupled Tile Assembly Model (DTAM) and the rgTAM into the DrgTAM, we derive a model which is actually more powerful at temperature-1 than the aTAM at temperature-2. Specifically, the DrgTAM, at temperature-1, can simulate any aTAM system of any temperature, and it also contains systems which cannot be simulated by any system in the aTAM.", "venue": "Natural Computing", "authors": ["Jacob  Hendricks", "Matthew J.

To exploit the full potential of such a system, an indepth understanding of the interplay between the spatial user density and inter-user interference (IUI) and its impact on the system performance is needed. In this paper, we consider a three-dimensional unbounded domain with multiple spatially distributed point-to-point non-cooperative transmission links, where both the TXs and RXs are positioned on a regular fixed grid. For this setup, we first derive an analytical expression for the channel impulse responses (CIRs) between the TXs and RXs in the system. Then, we derive the maximum likelihood (ML) detector for the RXs and show that it reduces to a threshold-based detector. Moreover, we derive an analytical expression for the corresponding detection threshold which depends on the statistics of the desired signal, the statistics of the MC channel, and the statistics of the IUI. We also provide a low-complexity suboptimal decision threshold. Furthermore, we derive an analytical expression for the bit error rate and the achievable rate of a single transmission link. Finally, we propose a new performance metric, which we refer to as area rate efficiency (ARE), that captures the tradeoff between the transmission link density and the IUI. The ARE characterizes how efficiently the available TX and RX areas are used for information transmission and is expressed in bits per unit area. We show that there exists an optimal transmission link density for maximizing the ARE. The presented results reveal that the optimal link density depends on the number of molecules used for modulation and the value of the diffusion coefficient, while the impact of the chosen grid structure and the concentration of background noise molecules is negligible.

One of the main challenges in MCvD is the intersymbol interference (ISI), which inhibits communication at high data rates. Furthermore, at nanoscale, energy efficiency becomes an essential problem. Before addressing these problems, a predetermined threshold for the received signal must be calculated to make a decision. In this paper, an analytical technique is proposed to determine the optimum threshold, whereas in the literature, these thresholds are calculated empirically. Since the main goal of this paper is to build an MCvD system suitable for operating at high data rates without sacrificing quality, new modulation and filtering techniques are proposed to decrease the effects of ISI and enhance energy efficiency. As a transmitter-based solution, a modulation technique, molecular transition shift keying (MTSK), is proposed in order to increase the data rate by suppressing ISI. Furthermore, for energy efficiency, a power adjustment technique that utilizes the residual molecules is proposed. Finally, as a receiver-based solution, a new energy efficient decision feedback filter (DFF) is proposed as a substitute for the conventional decoders in the literature.

In order to satisfy standard statistical results, individual p-bits not only need to be updated sequentially but also in order from the parent to the child nodes, necessitating the use of sequencers in software implementations. In this article, we first use SPICE simulations to show that an autonomous hardware Bayesian network can operate correctly without any clocks or sequencers, but only if the individual p-bits are appropriately designed. We then present a simple behavioral model of the autonomous hardware illustrating the essential characteristics needed for correct sequencer-free operation. This model is also benchmarked against SPICE simulations and can be used to simulate large-scale networks. Our results could be useful in the design of hardware accelerators that use energy-efficient building blocks suited for low-level implementations of Bayesian networks.

Furthermore, as it is capable of Turing universal computation, the aTAM allows algorithmic self-assembly, in which the components can be designed so that the rules governing their behaviors force them to inherently execute prescribed algorithms as they combine. This power has yielded a wide variety of theoretical results in the aTAM utilizing algorithmic self-assembly to design systems capable of performing complex computations and forming extremely intricate structures. Adding to the completeness of the model, in FOCS 2012 the aTAM was shown to also be intrinsically universal, which means that there exists one single tile set such that for any arbitrary input aTAM system, that tile set can be configured into a \"seed\" structure which will then cause self-assembly using that tile set to simulate the input system, capturing its full dynamics modulo only a scale factor. However, the \"universal simulator\" of that result makes use of nondeterminism in terms of the tiles placed in several key locations when different assembly sequences are followed. This nondeterminism remains even when the simulator is simulating a system which is directed, meaning that it has exactly one unique terminal assembly and for any given location, no matter which assembly sequence is followed, the same tile type is always placed there. The question which then arose was whether or not that nondeterminism is fundamentally required, and if any universal simulator must in fact utilize more nondeterminism than directed systems when simulating them. In this paper, we answer that question in the affirmative: the class of directed systems in the aTAM is not intrinsically universal, meaning there is no universal simulator for directed systems which itself is always directed. This result provides a powerful insight into the role of nondeterminism in self-assembly, which is itself a fundamentally nondeterministic process occurring via unguided local interactions. Furthermore, to achieve this result we leverage powerful results of computational complexity hierarchies, including tight bounds on both best and worst-case complexities of decidable languages, to tailor design systems with precisely controllable space resources available to computations embedded within them. We also develop novel techniques for designing systems containing subsystems with disjoint, mutually exclusive computational powers.

Within this highly generalized model we provide three new solutions to tile self-assembly problems that have been addressed within the abstract Tile Assembly Model and its variants, showing that signal passing tiles allow for substantial improvement across multiple complexity metrics. Our first result utilizes a recursive assembly process to achieve tile-type efficient assembly of linear structures, using provably fewer tile types than what is possible in standard tile assembly models. Our second system of signal-passing tiles simulates any Turing machine with high fuel efficiency by using only a constant number of tiles per computation step.

This result is of particular interest in that it is known that this pattern cannot self-assemble within a number of well studied tile self-assembly models.

It has been known since the early 1990s that reversible computing based on adiabatic switching is possible in CMOS, although almost all the \"adiabatic\" CMOS logic families in the literature are not actually fully adiabatic, which limits their achievable energy savings. The first CMOS logic style achieving truly, fully adiabatic operation if leakage was negligible (CRL) was not fully static, which led to practical engineering difficulties in the presence of certain nonidealities. Later, \"static\" adiabatic logic families were described, but they were not actually fully adiabatic, or fully static, and were much slower.In this paper, we describe a new logic family, Static 2-Level Adiabatic Logic (S2LAL), which is, to our knowledge, the first CMOS logic family that is both fully static, and truly, fully adiabatic (modulo leakage). In addition, S2LAL is, we think, the fastest possible such family (among fully pipelined sequential circuits), having a latency per logic stage of one tick (transition time), and a minimum clock period (initiation interval) of 8 ticks. S2LAL requires 8 phases of a trapezoidal power-clock waveform (plus constant power and ground references) to be supplied. We argue that, if implemented in a suitable fabrication process designed to aggressively minimize leakage, S2LAL should be capable of demonstrating a greater level of energy efficiency than any other semiconductor-based digital logic family known today.", "venue": "2020 International Conference on Rebooting Computing (ICRC)", "authors": ["Michael P.

The biological nature of chemical signaling makes MC a promising methodology for interdisciplinary applications requiring communication between cells and other microscale devices. However, since the life sciences and communications engineering fields have distinct approaches to formulating and solving research problems, the mismatch between them can hinder the translation of research results and impede the development and implementation of interdisciplinary solutions. To bridge this gap, this survey proposes a novel communication hierarchy for MC signaling in cell biology and maps phenomena, contributions, and problems to the hierarchy. The hierarchy includes: 1) the physical propagation of cell signaling at the Physical Signal Propagation level; 2) the generation, reception, and biochemical pathways of molecular signals at the Physical and Chemical Signal Interaction level; 3) the quantification of physical signals, including macroscale observation and control methods, and conversion of signals to information at the Signal-Data Interface level; 4) the interpretation of information in cell signals and the realization of synthetic systems to store, process, and communicate molecular signals at the Local Data Abstraction level; and 5) applications relying on communication with MC signals at the Application level. To further demonstrate the proposed hierarchy, it is applied to case studies on quorum sensing, neuronal signaling, and communication via DNA. Finally, several open problems are identified for each level and the integration of multiple levels. The proposed hierarchy provides language for communication engineers to study and interface with biological systems, and also helps biologists to understand how communications engineering concepts can be exploited to interpret, control, and manipulate signaling in cell biology.", "venue": "IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials", "authors": ["Dadi  Bi", "Apostolos  Almpanis", "Adam  Noel", "Yansha  Deng", "Robert  Schober"], "year": 2021, "n_citations": 14}

While the rectangular mesh is favored for its compactness and uniformity, its geometry resists conventional self-configuration approaches, which are essential to programming large meshes in the presence of fabrication error. Here, we present a new configuration algorithm, related to the 2 \u00d7 2 block decomposition of a unitary matrix, that overcomes this limitation. Our proposed algorithm is robust to errors, requires no prior knowledge of the process variations, and relies only on external sources and detectors. We show that self-configuration using this technique reduces the effect of fabrication errors by the same quadratic factor observed in triangular meshes. This relaxes a significant limit to the size of multiport interferometers, removing a major roadblock to the scaling of optical quantum and machinelearning hardware. Large-scale programmable photonic circuits are the cornerstone of many emerging technologies, including quantum computing [1, 2], machine learning acceleration [3\u2013 5], and microwave photonics [6, 7]. One such circuit\u2014the universal multiport interferometer, which functions as a linear optical input-output device with a programmable transfer matrix (Fig. 1)\u2014is of special importance due to its generality and broad range of applications [8]. The most scalable designs involve meshes of Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZIs): while the triangular Reck mesh (Fig. 1(a)) was initially employed and is straightforward to configure [9], more recently work has shifted to the Clements rectangle (Fig. 1(b)), which offers clear advantages of compactness, path-length uniformity, and reduced sensitivity to loss [10]. Much recent study has focused on scaling [11, 12] and optimizing [13\u201316] MZI meshes based on the Clements design. A major challenge to scaling MZI meshes is the presence of component errors due to fabrication imperfections. Errors cause each MZI transfer matrix to deviate from its programmed value (Fig. 1(c)); since the overall circuit is a cascade of MZIs with O(N) depth, the total error in the transfer matrix scales as O( \u221a N), where N is the circuit size (assuming uncorrelated errors). At large mesh sizes, these errors (if left uncorrected) place unreasonable constraints on fabrication tolerances, ultimately limiting the scaling of multiport interferometers. Error-correction techniques are therefore critical for largescale programmable photonics. Global optimization [13\u2013 15] and in-situ training [17] are promising in principle, but computationally inefficient and device-specific. Local per-MZI correction is also effective, but requires prior characterization of the device errors [18]. A number of efficient \u201cself-configuring\u201d algorithms have been proposed [19\u201321], but these generally only work for triangular meshes and require large numbers of internal power monitors [22], a significant addition in hardware complexity. Recently, we proposed an efficient error-correction algorithm that does not require internal detectors or accurate pre-characterization [23]. However, this algorithm only works for triangular (i.e. Reck) meshes, which excludes the more efficient Clements design. In this Letter, we present a new self-configuring strategy that is naturally adapted to the Clements design and requires no additional hardware complexity beyond external sources and (coherent) detectors. This algorithm proceeds by configuring the diagonals of the mesh, starting at the corners, in a manner that progressively zeroes out the elements of a target matrix through a sequence of Givens rotations. Numerical experiments on imperfect MZI meshes show that our algorithm is stable and robust, and reduces errors by at least a quadratic factor (while sufficiently small errors are corrected exactly), consistent", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Ryan  Hamerly", "Saumil  Bandyopadhyay", "Dirk  Englund"], "year": 2021, "n_citations": 4}

Advances in photonic integrated circuits have enabled research in photonic computation15-17, where, despite offering excellent features such as fast linear computation, no integrated photonic deep network has been demonstrated to date due to the lack of scalable on-chip nonlinear functionality and the loss of photonic devices, making scalability to a large number of layers challenging. Here we report the first integrated end-to-end photonic deep neural network (PDNN) that performs instantaneous image classification through direct processing of optical waves. Images are formed on the input grating coupler array (pixels). Optical waves impinging on different pixels are coupled into nanophotonic waveguides and processed as the light propagates through layers of neurons on-chip. Each neuron generates an optical output from input optical signals, where linear computation is performed optically and the nonlinear activation function is realised optoelectronically. The output of a laser coupled into the chip is uniformly distributed among all neurons within the network providing the same per-neuron supply light. Thus, all neurons have the same optical output range enabling scalability to a deep network with a large number of layers. The PDNN chip is used for 2and 4-class classification of handwritten letters achieving accuracies of higher than 93.7% and 90.3%, respectively, with a computation time less than a single clock cycle of stateof-the-art digital computation platforms.

These architectures are ideal for dense layers with fewer than roughly a thousand neurons. However, for large sparse layers, crossbar architectures are highly inefficient. A new hardware architecture, dubbed the MN3 (Memristive Nanowire Neural Network), was recently described as an efficient architecture for simulating very wide, sparse neural network layers, on the order of millions of neurons per layer. The MN3 utilizes a high-density memristive nanowire mesh to efficiently connect large numbers of silicon neurons with modifiable weights. Here, in order to explore the MN3's ability to function as a deep neural network, we describe one algorithm for training deep MN3 models and benchmark simulations of the architecture on two deep learning tasks. We utilize a simple piecewise linear memristor model, since we seek to demonstrate that training is, in principle, possible for randomized nanowire architectures. In future work, we intend on utilizing more realistic memristor models, and we will adapt the presented algorithm appropriately. We show that the MN3 is capable of performing composition, gradient propagation, and weight updates, which together allow it to function as a deep neural network. We show that a simulated multilayer perceptron (MLP), built from MN3 networks, can obtain a 1.61% error rate on the popular MNIST dataset, comparable to equivalently sized software-based network.

There are several unique features in the proposed architecture that tightly link with the HTM algorithm. A memristor that is suitable for emulating the HTM synapses is identified and a new Z-window function is proposed. The architecture exploits the concept of synthetic synapses to enable potential synapses in the HTM. The crossbar for the SP avoids dark spots caused by unutilized crossbar regions and supports rapid on-chip training within two clock cycles. This research also leverages plasticity mechanisms such as neurogenesis and homeostatic intrinsic plasticity to strengthen the robustness and performance of the SP.

Our initial experiments focus on compiling Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (QAOA) circuits whose high number of commuting gates allow great flexibility in the order in which the gates can be applied.

It can be realized if time non-locality (memory) is present. A practical realization of self-organizing logic gates (SOLGs) can be done by combining circuit elements with and without memory. By employing one such realization, we show, numerically, that SOLGs exploit elementary instantons to reach equilibrium points. Instantons are classical trajectories of the non-linear equations of motion describing SOLGs, and connect topologically distinct critical points in the phase space. By linear analysis at those points, we show that these instantons connect the initial critical point of the dynamics, with at least one unstable direction, directly to the final fixed point. We also show that the memory content of these gates only affects the relaxation time to reach the logically consistent solution. Finally, we demonstrate, by solving the corresponding stochastic differential equations, that since instantons connect critical points, noise and perturbations may change the instanton trajectory in the phase space, but not the initial and final critical points. Therefore, even for extremely large noise levels, the gates self-organize to the correct solution.

Hence, it is crucial for the control microarchitecture to issue quantum operations to the Quantum Processing Unit (QPU) in time. As in classical microarchitecture, parallelism in quantum programs needs to be exploited for speedup. However, three challenges emerge in the quantum scenario: 1) the quantum feedback control can introduce significant pipeline stall latency; 2) timing control is required for all quantum operations; 3) QPU requires a deterministic operation supply to prevent the accumulation of quantum errors. In this paper, we propose a novel control microarchitecture design to exploit Circuit Level Parallelism (CLP) and Quantum Operation Level Parallelism (QOLP). Firstly, we develop a Multiprocessor architecture to exploit CLP, which supports dynamic scheduling of different sub-circuits. This architecture can handle parallel feedback control and minimize the potential overhead that disrupts the timing control. Secondly, we propose a Quantum Superscalar approach that exploits QOLP by efficiently executing massive quantum instructions in parallel. Both methods issue quantum operations to QPU deterministically. In the benchmark test of a Shor syndrome measurement, a six-core implementation of our proposal achieves up to 2.59 \u00d7 speedup compared with a single core.

Hard realization admits paying as much as necessary implementation costs to preserve computation precision and determinism throughout all the design and implementation steps. Despite its prior accomplishments, this conventional paradigm has encountered serious challenges with today's emerging applications and implementation technologies. Unlike traditional hard computing, the emerging soft and bio-inspired algorithms do not rely on fully precise and deterministic computation.

In order to achieve the millisecond to second time constants required for these synaptic dynamics, analog subthreshold circuits are usually employed. However, due to process variation and leakage problems, it is almost impossible to port these types of circuits to modern sub-100nm technologies. In contrast, we present a neuromorphic system in a 28 nm CMOS process that employs switched capacitor (SC) circuits to implement 128 short term plasticity presynapses as well as 8192 stop-learning synapses. The neuromorphic system consumes an area of 0.36 mm2 and runs at a power consumption of 1.9 mW. The circuit makes use of a technique for minimizing leakage effects allowing for real-time operation with time constants up to several seconds. Since we rely on SC techniques for all calculations, the system is composed of only generic mixed-signal building blocks. These generic building blocks make the system easy to port between technologies and the large digital circuit part inherent in an SC system benefits fully from technology scaling.", "venue": "Front.

As we know the peak temperature of chip increases in 3-dimensional structures compared to 2-dimensional ones due to the reduced space in intra-layer and inter-layer components. In sub-nanometre scale technologies, it is inevitable to analysis the heat developed in individual chip to extract the temperature distribution of the entire chip. With the technology scaling in new generation ICs more and more components are integrated to a smaller area. Along with the other parameters threshold voltage is also scaled down which results in exponential increase in leakage current. This has resulted in rise in hotspot temperature value due to increase in leakage power.

While some efforts have been made to capture the performance evolution more accurately, they eventually deviate from the observed development pace. Thus, a holistic figure of merit (FOM) is needed to adequately compare these recent technology paradigms. Here we introduce the Capability-to-Latency-Energy-Amount-Resistance (CLEAR) FOM derived from device and link performance criteria of both active optoelectronic devices and passive components alike. As such CLEAR incorporates communication delay, energy efficiency, on-chip scaling and economic cost. We show that CLEAR accurately describes compute development including most recent machines. Since this FOM is derived bottom-up, we demonstrate remarkable adaptability to applications ranging from device-level to network and system-level. Applying CLEAR to benchmark device, link, and network performance against fundamental physical compute and communication limits shows that photonics is competitive even for fractions of the die-size, thus making a case for on-chip optical interconnects.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Shuai  Sun", "Vikram K.

In practice, the precision of these operations is always bounded, first by the random mismatch error occurred during system implementation, and subsequently by the intrinsic quantization error determined by the system architecture itself. Methods: Here, we derive a new mathematical interpretation of the previously proposed redundant sensing architecture that not only suppresses mismatch error but also allows achieving an effective resolution exceeding the system's intrinsic resolution, i.e., super-resolution (SR). SR is enabled by an endogenous property of redundant structures regarded as \u201ccode diffusion\u201d where the references\u2019 value spreads into the neighbor sample space as a result of mismatch error. Results: Using Monte Carlo methods, we show a profound theoretical increase of 8\u20139 b effective resolution or 256\u2013512\u00d7 enhancement of precision on a 10-b device at 95% sample space. Conclusion: The proposed SR mechanism can be applied to substantially improve the precision of various AD and DA conversion processes beyond the system resource constraints. Significance: The concept opens the possibility for a wide range of applications in low-power fully integrated sensors and devices where the cost-accuracy tradeoff is inevitable.

In this work, we present a class of new designs for reversible binary and BCD adder circuits. The proposed designs are primarily optimized for the number of ancilla inputs and the number of garbage outputs and are designed for possible best values for the quantum cost and delay. In reversible circuits, in addition to the primary inputs, some constant input bits are used to realize different logic functions which are referred to as ancilla inputs and are overheads that need to be reduced. Further, the garbage outputs which do not contribute to any useful computations but are needed to maintain reversibility are also overheads that need to be reduced in reversible designs. First, we propose two new designs for the reversible ripple carry adder: (i) one with no input carry c0 and no ancilla input bits, and (ii) one with input carry c0 and no ancilla input bits. The proposed reversible ripple carry adder designs with no ancilla input bits have less quantum cost and logic depth (delay) compared to their existing counterparts in the literature. In these designs, the quantum cost and delay are reduced by deriving designs based on the reversible Peres gate and the TR gate. Next, four new designs for the reversible BCD adder are presented based on the following two approaches: (i) the addition is performed in binary mode and correction is applied to convert to BCD when required through detection and correction, and (ii) the addition is performed in binary mode and the result is always converted using a binary to BCD converter.

We examine the number of distinct tile types needed to assemble shapes within this model, the temperature required for efficient assembly, and the problem of designing compact geometric faces to meet given compatibility specifications. We pose the following question: can complex geometric tile faces arbitrarily reduce the number of distinct tile types to assemble shapes? Within the most basic generalization of the aTAM, we show that the answer is no. For almost all n at least $\\Omega(\\sqrt{\\log n})$ tile types are required to uniquely assemble an n\u00d7n square, regardless of how much complexity is pumped into the face of each tile type. However, we show for all n we can achieve a matching $O(\\sqrt{\\log n})$ tile types, beating the known lower bound of \u0398(logn / loglogn) that holds for almost all n within the aTAM. Further, our result holds at temperature \u03c4=1. Our next result considers a geometric tile model that is a generalization of the 2-handed abstract tile assembly model in which tile aggregates must move together through obstacle free paths within the plane. Within this model we present a novel construction that harnesses the collision free path requirement to allow for the unique assembly of any n\u00d7n square with a sleek O(loglogn) distinct tile types. This construction is of interest in that it is the first tile self-assembly result to harness collision free planar translation to increase efficiency, whereas previous work has simply used the planarity restriction as a desireable quality that could be achieved at reduced efficiency. This surprisingly low tile type result further emphasizes a fundamental open question: Is it possible to assemble n\u00d7n squares with O(1) distinct tile types?

Landauer discussed that it is impossible to break this limit as long as the computations are performed in the conventional, non-reversible way. But even if reversible computations were performed, the basic energy needed for operating circuits realized in conventional technologies is still far above the (kBT ln 2) energy limit (i.e., the circuits do not operate in a physically reversible manner). In contrast, novel nanotechnologies like Quantum-dot Cellular Automata (QCA) allow for computations with very low energy dissipation and hence are promising candidates for breaking this limit. Accordingly, the design of reversible QCA circuits is an active field of research. But whether QCA in general and the proposed circuits in particular are indeed able to operate in a logically and physically reversible fashion is unknown thus far, because neither physical realizations nor appropriate simulation approaches are available. In this work, we address this gap by utilizing an established theoretical model that has been implemented in a physics simulator enabling a precise consideration of how energy is dissipated in QCA designs.

However, there are few offerings for non-specialists and little information on best practices for training computer science and engineering students. In this report we describe our experience teaching an undergraduate course on quantum computing using a practical, software-driven approach. We centered our course around teaching quantum algorithms through hands-on programming, reducing the significance of traditional written assignments and relying instead on self-paced programming exercises (\"Quantum Katas''), a variety of programming assignments, and a final project. We observed that the programming sections of the course helped students internalize theoretical material presented during the lectures. In the survey results, students indicated that the programming exercises and the final project contributed the most to their learning process. We describe the motivation for centering the course around quantum programming, discuss major artifacts used in this course, and present our lessons learned and best practices for a future improved course offering. We hope that our experience will help guide instructors who want to adopt a practical approach to teaching quantum computing and will enable more undergraduate programs to offer quantum programming as an elective.", "venue": "SIGCSE", "authors": ["Mariia  Mykhailova", "Krysta Marie Svore"], "year": 2020, "n_citations": 7}

Physarum polycephalum is used as a model organism in biocomputing because it can create `wires' for use in hybrid circuits; programmable growth by manipulation through external stimuli and the ability withstanding a current and its tolerance to hybridisation with a variety of nano/microparticles. Lettuce seedlings have also had previous interest invested in them for generating plant wires, although currently there is little information as to their suitability for such applications. In this study both P. polycephalum and Lettuce seedlings were hybridised with gold nanoparticles - functionalised and unfunctionalised - to explore their uptake, toxicological effects and, crucially, any alterations in electrical properties they bestow upon the organisms. Using various microscopy techniques it was shown that P. polycephalum and lettuce seedlings are able to internalize nanoparticles and assemble them in vivo, however some toxicological effects were observed. The electrical resistance of both lettuce seedlings and P. polycephalum was found to decrease, the most significant reduction being with lettuce seedlings whose resistance reduced from 3MOhms to 0.5MOhms. We conclude that gold is a suitable nanomaterial for biohybridisation specifically in creating conductive pathways for more efficient biological wires in self-growing hybrid circuitry.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Nina  Gizzie", "Richard  Mayne", "Shlomo  Yitzchaik", "Muhamad  Ikbal", "Andrew  Adamatzky"], "year": 2015, "n_citations": 8}

To solve these problems, we propose a framework for a computational model that follows a natural computational system, such as the human brain, and does not rely heavily on electronic computers. In particular, we propose a methodology based on the concept of `computation harvesting', which uses IoT data collected from rich sensors and leaves most of the computational processes to real-world phenomena as collected data. This aspect assumes that large-scale computations can be fast and resilient. Herein, we perform prediction tasks using real-world road traffic data to show the feasibility of computation harvesting. First, we show that the substantial computation in traffic flow is resilient against sensor failure and real-time traffic changes due to several combinations of harvesting from spatiotemporal dynamics to synthesize specific patterns.

Prior works on IRS mainly consider continuous phase shifts at reflecting elements, which are practically difficult to implement due to the hardware limitation. In contrast, we study in this paper an IRS-aided wireless network, where an IRS with only a finite number of phase shifts at each element is deployed to assist in the communication from a multi-antenna access point (AP) to multiple single-antenna users. We aim to minimize the transmit power at the AP by jointly optimizing the continuous transmit precoding at the AP and the discrete reflect phase shifts at the IRS, subject to a given set of minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints at the user receivers. The considered problem is shown to be a mixed-integer non-linear program (MINLP) and thus is difficult to solve in general. To tackle this problem, we first study the single-user case with one user assisted by the IRS and propose both optimal and suboptimal algorithms for solving it. Besides, we analytically show that as compared to the ideal case with continuous phase shifts, the IRS with discrete phase shifts achieves the same squared power gain in terms of asymptotically large number of reflecting elements, while a constant proportional power loss is incurred that depends only on the number of phase-shift levels. The proposed designs for the single-user case are also extended to the general setup with multiple users among which some are aided by the IRS.

In particular, the transmitter has to be able to control the release of signaling molecules for modulation of the information bits. An important class of control mechanisms in natural cells for releasing molecules is based on ion channels which are pore-forming proteins across the cell membrane whose opening and closing may be controlled by a gating parameter. In this paper, a modulator for DMC based on ion channels is proposed which controls the rate at which molecules are released from the transmitter by modulating a gating parameter signal. Exploiting the capabilities of the proposed modulator, an on-off keying modulation scheme is introduced and the corresponding average modulated signal, i.e., the average release rate of the molecules from the transmitter, is derived in the Laplace domain. By making a simplifying assumption, a closed-form expression for the average modulated signal in the time domain is obtained which constitutes an upper bound on the total number of released molecules regardless of this assumption. The derived average modulated signal is compared to results obtained with a particle based simulator. The numerical results show that the derived upper bound is tight if the number of ion channels distributed across the transmitter (cell) membrane is small.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Hamidreza  Arjmandi", "Arman  Ahmadzadeh", "Robert  Schober", "Masoumeh  Nasiri-Kenari"], "year": 2015, "n_citations": 1}

In this paper, a library-based synthesis methodology for reversible circuits is proposed where a reversible specification is considered as a permutation comprising a set of cycles. To this end, a pre-synthesis optimization step is introduced to construct a reversible specification from an irreversible function. In addition, a cycle-based representation model is presented to be used as an intermediate format in the proposed synthesis methodology. The selected intermediate format serves as a focal point for all potential representation models. In order to synthesize a given function, a library containing seven building blocks is used where each building block is a cycle of length less than 6. To synthesize large cycles, we also propose a decomposition algorithm which produces all possible minimal and inequivalent factorizations for a given cycle of length greater than 5. All decompositions contain the maximum number of disjoint cycles. The generated decompositions are used in conjunction with a novel cycle assignment algorithm which is proposed based on the graph matching problem to select the best possible cycle pairs. Then, each pair is synthesized by using the available components of the library. The decomposition algorithm together with the cycle assignment method are considered as a binding method which selects a building block from the library for each cycle. Finally, a post-synthesis optimization step is introduced to optimize the synthesis results in terms of different costs. To analyze the proposed methodology, various experiments are performed. Our analyses on the available reversible benchmark functions reveal that the proposed library-based synthesis methodology can produce low-cost circuits in some cases compared with the current approaches.

We conclude that elliptic curve discrete logarithms on an elliptic curve defined over an $n$-bit prime field can be computed on a quantum computer with at most $9n + 2\\lceil\\log_2(n)\\rceil+10$ qubits using a quantum circuit of at most $448 n^3 \\log_2(n) + 4090 n^3$ Toffoli gates. We are able to classically simulate the Toffoli networks corresponding to the controlled elliptic curve point addition as the core piece of Shor's algorithm for the NIST standard curves P-192, P-224, P-256, P-384 and P-521. Our approach allows gate-level comparisons to recent resource estimates for Shor's factoring algorithm. The results also support estimates given earlier by Proos and Zalka and indicate that, for current parameters at comparable classical security levels, the number of qubits required to tackle elliptic curves is less than for attacking RSA, suggesting that indeed ECC is an easier target than RSA.", "venue": "ASIACRYPT", "authors": ["Martin  R\u00f6tteler", "Michael  Naehrig", "Krysta Marie Svore", "Kristin E.

Owing to the large parameter space and cost of evaluating each parameter in the search space, manually tuning of DNN hyperparameters is impractical. Automatic joint DNN and hardware hyperparameter optimization is indispensable for such problems. Bayesian optimization-based approaches have shown promising results for hyperparameter optimization of DNNs. However, most of these techniques have been developed without considering the underlying hardware, thereby leading to inefficient designs. Further, the few works that perform joint optimization are not generalizable and mainly focus on CMOS-based architectures.

Lopez-Suarez, I. Neri, and L. Gammaitoni (LNG) present a concrete realization of the Boolean OR irreversible gate, but contrary to the standard Landauer principle, with an arbitrary small dissipation of energy. A Popperian good falsification! In this paper we discuss a theoretical description of the LNG device which is indeed a 3in/3out self--reversible realization of the involved OR gate, satisfying in this way the Landauer principle of no dispersion of energy, contrary to the LNG conclusions. The different point of view is due to a different interpretation of the two outputs corresponding to the inputs 10 and 01, which are considered by LNG indistinguishable so producing a non reversible realization of the standard 2in/1out gate. On the contrary, always considering these two outputs indistinguishable, by a suitable normalization function of the cantilever angles, the experimental results obtained by the LNG device coincide with the OR connective obtained from the third output of the self-reversible 3in/3out CL gate by the Inputs-Ancilla->Garbage-Output procedure. Thus, by the self-reversibility this realization is without dissipation of energy according to the Landauer principle. Furthermore, using the self-reversible Toffoli gate it is possible to obtain from the LNG device the realization of the connective AND adopting another normalization function on the cantilever angles. Finally, by other suitable normalization procedures on cantilever angles it is possible to obtain also the other logic NOR and NAND connectives, and in a more sophisticated way the XOR and NXOR connectives in a self-reversible way. All this leads to introduce a universal logic machine consisting of the LNG device plus a memory containing all the necessary angle normalization functions to produce in a self-reversible way, by choosing one of these latter, the logic connectives now listed.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Gianpiero  Cattaneo", "Roberto  Leporini"], "year": 2017, "n_citations": 0}

Since every bit operation that does not use all of the bits performs an even permutation, we need to use at least one auxiliary bit to perform every permutation, and it is known that one bit is indeed enough. Without auxiliary bits, all even permutations can be implemented. We generalize these results to non-binary logic: If $A$ is a finite set of odd cardinality then a finite gate set can generate all permutations of $A^n$ for all $n$, without any auxiliary symbols. If the cardinality of $A$ is even then, by the same argument as above, only even permutations of $A^n$ can be implemented for large $n$, and we show that indeed all even permutations can be obtained from a finite universal gate set. We also consider the conservative case, that is, those permutations of $A^n$ that preserve the weight of the input word. The weight is the vector that records how many times each symbol occurs in the word. It turns out that no finite conservative gate set can, for all $n$, implement all conservative even permutations of $A^n$ without auxiliary bits.

In this contribution to the focus collection on \"What would you do with 1000 qubits?\", we provide concrete examples of intractable ML tasks that could be enhanced with near-term devices. We argue that to reach this target, the focus should be on areas where ML researchers are struggling, such as generative models in unsupervised and semi-supervised learning, instead of the popular and more tractable supervised learning techniques. We also highlight the case of classical datasets with potential quantum-like statistical correlations where quantum models could be more suitable. We focus on hybrid quantum-classical approaches and illustrate some of the key challenges we foresee for near-term implementations. Finally, we introduce the quantum-assisted Helmholtz machine (QAHM), an attempt to use near-term quantum devices to tackle high-dimensional datasets of continuous variables. Instead of using quantum computers to assist deep learning, as previous approaches do, the QAHM uses deep learning to extract a low-dimensional binary representation of data, suitable for relatively small quantum processors which can assist the training of an unsupervised generative model.

Because this weight-updating method can compensate the demerit of asymmetric weight updates, we can obtain better accuracy compared to other methods.

However, this lower bound is achievable only for quasistatic, near-equilibrium computations -- that is, only over infinite time. In practice, information processing takes place in finite time, resulting in dissipation and potentially unreliable logical outcomes. For overdamped Langevin dynamics, we show that counterdiabatic potentials can be crafted to guide systems rapidly and accurately along desired computational paths, providing shortcuts that allows for the precise design of finite-time computations. Such shortcuts require additional work, beyond Landauer's bound, that is irretrievably dissipated into the environment. We show that this dissipated work is proportional to the computation rate as well as the square of the information-storing system's length scale. As a paradigmatic example, we design shortcuts to erase a bit of information metastably stored in a double-well potential. Though dissipated work generally increases with erasure fidelity, we show that it is possible perform perfect erasure in finite time with finite work. We also show that the robustness of information storage affects the energetic cost of erasure---specifically, the dissipated work scales as the information lifetime of the bistable system. Our analysis exposes a rich and nuanced relationship between work, speed, size of the information-bearing degrees of freedom, storage robustness, and the difference between initial and final informational statistics.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Alexander B.

Several software-based adversarial defenses have been proposed in the past to make DNNs adversarially robust. However, no previous work has demonstrated the advantage conferred by the non-idealities present in analog crossbars in terms of adversarial robustness. In this work, we show that the intrinsic hardware variations manifested through crossbar non-idealities yield adversarial robustness to the mapped DNNs without any additional optimization.

Using particle-based simulators, the channel's impulse response is obtained and mathematically modeled. These models are then used to determine interlink interference (ILI) and intersymbol interference (ISI).

Such current variations create a thermal gradient within each crossbar of the hardware, depending on the machine learning workload and the mapping of neurons and synapses of the workload to these crossbars. \\mr{This thermal gradient becomes significant at scaled technology nodes and it increases the leakage power in the hardware leading to an increase in the energy consumption.} We propose a novel technique to map neurons and synapses of SNN-based machine learning workloads to neuromorphic hardware.

Second, we incorporate this thermal model in the mapping of neurons and synapses of SNN-based workloads using a hill-climbing heuristic. The objective is to reduce the thermal gradient in crossbars.

This paper, as the first attempt towards this direction, proposes a novel memristor crossbar-based framework for solving two important convex optimization problems, i.e., second-order cone programming (SOCP) and homogeneous quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) problems. In this paper, the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is adopted. It splits the SOCP and homogeneous QCQP problems into sub-problems that involve the solution of linear systems, which could be effectively solved using the memristor crossbar in O(1) time complexity. The proposed algorithm is an iterative procedure that iterates a constant number of times.

As these programs and processes become more complex and their envisioned safetycritical applications approach deployment, it is essential to develop methods for engineering trustworthiness into molecular programs.

This paper presents a method for dealing with one such challenge, namely, the difficulty of ascertaining how robust a molecular program is to perturbations of the relative \"clock speeds\" of its various reactions. The method proposed here is gametheoretic. The robustness of a molecular program is quantified in terms of its ability to win (achieve its original objective) in games against other molecular programs that manipulate its relative clock speeds. This game-theoretic approach is general enough to quantify the security of a molecular program against malicious manipulations of its relative clock speeds.

Unlike conventional computational frameworks that operate on numbers, HDC, like the brain, uses high dimensional random vectors and is capable of one-shot learning. HDC is based on a well-defined set of arithmetic operations and is highly error-resilient. The core operations of HDC manipulate HD vectors in bulk bit-wise fashion, offering many opportunities to leverage parallelism. Unfortunately, on conventional Von-Neuman architectures, the continuous movement of HD vectors among the processor and the memory can make the cognition task prohibitively slow and energy-intensive. Hardware accelerators only marginally improve related metrics. On the contrary, only partial implementation of an HDC framework inside memory, using emerging memristive devices, has reported considerable performance/energy gains. This paper presents an architecture based on racetrack memory (RTM) to conduct and accelerate the entire HDC framework within the memory. The proposed solution requires minimal additional CMOS circuitry and uses a read operation across multiple domains in RTMs called transverse read (TR) to realize exclusive-or (XOR) and addition operations. To minimize the overhead the CMOS circuitry, we propose an RTM nanowires-based counting mechanism that leverages the TR operation and the standard RTM operations.

Code review is commonly used for identifying programming defects.

An automated approach for assisting in code reviews is thus highly desirable. We present a tool for assisting in code review and results from our experiments evaluating the tool in different scenarios. The tool leveraged content available from professional programmer support forums (eg, StackOverflow.com) to determine potential defectiveness of a given piece of source code.

The basic idea employed in the tool is (1) to identify a set P of discussion posts on Stack Overflow such that each p\u2208P contains source code fragment(s), which sufficiently resemble the input code C being reviewed, and (2) to determine the likelihood of C being defective by considering all p\u2208P.

The work is reminiscent of the verification procedure used in a polynomial-time algorithm for the quantum Arthur-Merlin games presented elsewhere, where the use of a quantum binary search to find a maximum eigenvalue in the final output stage has been adapted to the subset-sum problem as in another paper.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["David  Gunter", "Toks  Adedoyin"], "year": 2019, "n_citations": 0}

Because conventional wireless communication technologies face challenges in realizing new applications (e.g., in-body area networks for health monitoring) and necessitate the substitution of information carriers, researchers have shifted their interest to molecular communications (MC). Although remarkable progress has been made in this field over the last decade, advances have been far from acceptable for the achievement of its application objectives. A crucial problem of MC is the low data rate and high error rate inherent in particle dynamics specifications, in contrast to wave-based conventional communications. Therefore, it is important to investigate the resources by which MC can obtain additional information paths and provide strategies to exploit these resources. This study aims to examine techniques involving resource aggregation and exploitation to provide prospective directions for future progress in MC. In particular, we focus on state-of-the-art studies on multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. We discuss the possible advantages of applying MIMO to various MC system models. Furthermore, we survey various studies that aimed to achieve MIMO gains for the respective models, from theoretical background to prototypes.

Above the quantum supremacy threshold (approx. 60 qubits), NISQ machines are expected to be more powerful than existing classical computers. One of the most stringent problems is that computations (expressed as quantum circuits) have to be adapted (compiled) to the NISQ hardware, because the hardware does not support arbitrary interactions between the qubits. This procedure introduces additional gates (e.g. SWAP gates) into the circuits while leaving the implemented computations unchanged. Each additional gate increases the failure rate of the adapted (compiled) circuits, because the hardware and the circuits are not fault-tolerant. It is reasonable to expect that the placement influences the number of additionally introduced gates. Therefore, a combinatorial problem arises: how are circuit qubits allocated (placed) initially to the hardware qubits? The novelty of this work relies on the methodology used to investigate the influence of the initial placement. To this end, we introduce a novel heuristic and cost model to estimate the number of gates necessary to adapt a circuit to a given NISQ architecture. We implement the heuristic (source code available on github) and benchmark it using a standard compiler (e.g. from IBM Qiskit) treated as a black box. Preliminary results indicate that cost reductions of up to 10% can be achieved for practical circuit instances on realistic NISQ architectures only by placing qubits differently than default (trivial placement).", "venue": "QTOP@NetSys", "authors": ["Alexandru  Paler"], "year": 2017, "n_citations": 25}

For a comparable model size, HIC-based training outperforms baseline network, trained in floating-point 32-bit (FP32) precision, by leveraging appropriate network width multiplier. Furthermore, we observe that HIC-based training results in about 50 % less inference model size to achieve baseline comparable accuracy. We also show that the temporal drift in PCM devices has a negligible effect on post-training inference accuracy for extended periods (year). Finally, our simulations indicate HIC-based training naturally ensures that the number of write-erase cycles seen by the devices is a small fraction of the endurance limit of PCM, demonstrating the feasibility of this architecture for achieving hardware platforms that can learn in the field.", "venue": "2021 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)", "authors": ["Vinay  Joshi", "Wangxin  He", "Jae-sun  Seo", "Bipin  Rajendran"], "year": 2021, "n_citations": 0}

Therefore, the accurate modeling of the corresponding MC channel is of high importance. The propagation of particles in these systems is caused by a combination of diffusion and flow with a parabolic velocity profile, i.e., laminar flow. The propagation characteristics of the particles can be categorized into three different regimes: The flow dominant regime where the influence of diffusion on the particle transport is negligible, the dispersive regime where diffusion has a much stronger impact than flow, and the mixed regime where both effects are important. For the limiting regimes, i.e., the flow dominant and dispersive regimes, well-known solutions and approximations for particle transport exist. For the mixed regime, approximations, numerical techniques, and particle based simulations are employed. However, the few analytical models that are applicable in all three regimes impose significant constraints on the possible transmitter locations and particle release profiles. In this paper, we develop a more general analytical model for the advection-diffusion problem in cylindrical environments, which is applicable in all three regimes and accounts for general particle release models. The proposed model exhibits a higher accuracy than existing models and is based on a transfer function approach, where the main challenge is the incorporation of laminar flow.

The non-reciprocity of both device and interconnect is realized by sizing different contact areas at the input and the output as well as enhancing the local damping mechanism. The proposed logic is suitable for scaling due to a high energy barrier provided by a long FM wire.

The large size of TSVs and the proximity between them lead to undesirable coupling capacitance. This interference causes mutual influences between adjacent TSVs and produces crosstalk noise. Furthermore, this effect threats the reliability of data during traversal between layers. This paper proposes a mechanism that efficiently reduces crosstalk noise between TSVs with lower area overhead as compared to previous works. This mechanism revolves around the fact that retaining TSV value in current state can reduce coupling in some cases. To evaluate the mechanism, gem5 simulator is used for data extraction and several benchmarks are taken from the SPEC2006 suite.

The model was intentionally developed to abstract away not only the notion of time, but also the constraints of geometry. Collections of monomers with binding domains which allow them to form polymers via complementary bonds are analyzed to determine their final, stable configurations, which are those which maximize the number of bonds formed (i.e. enthalpy) and the number of independent components (i.e. entropy). In this paper, we first develop a definition of what it means for a TBN to perform a computation, and then present a set of constructions which are capable of performing computations by simulating the behaviors of space-bounded Turing machines and boolean circuits. In contrast to previous TBN results, these constructions are robust to great variability in the counts of monomers existing in the systems and the numbers of polymers that form in parallel. Although the Turing machine simulating TBNs are inefficient in terms of the numbers of unique monomer types required, as compared to algorithmic self-assembling systems in the abstract Tile Assembly Model (aTAM), we then show that a general strategy of porting those aTAM system designs to TBNs produces TBNs which incorrectly simulate computations. Finally, we present a refinement of the TBN model which we call the Geometric Thermodynamic Binding Networks (GTBN) model in which monomers are defined with rigid geometries and form rigid bonds.

Many of these challenges originate from the error characteristics that stem from rapid decoherence and noise during measurement, qubit connections, crosstalk, the qubits themselves, and transformations of qubit state via gates. Not only are qubits not \u201ccreated equal\u201d, but their noise level also changes over time. IBM is said to calibrate their quantum systems once per day and reports noise levels (errors) at the time of such calibration. This information is subsequently used to map circuits to higher quality qubits and connections up to the next calibration point. This work provides evidence that there is room for improvement over this daily calibration cycle. It contributes a technique to measure noise levels (errors) related to qubits immediately before executing one or more sensitive circuits and shows that just-in-time noise measurements can benefit late physical qubit mappings. With this just-in-time recalibrated transpilation, the fidelity of results is improved over IBM's default mappings, which only uses their daily calibrations. The framework assess two major sources of noise, namely readout errors (measurement errors) and two-qubit gate/connection errors.

Drawing inspiration from the usage of butterfly diagrams for FPRM and KRM forms, we devise a method to exhaustively construct all FPQF and KQF forms. Thus, the new forms can be used to optimize quantum circuits with arbitrary target unitary matrices, rather than only multi-controlled NOT gates such as CNOT, CCNOT, and their extensions. Experimental results on FPQF and KQF forms, as well as FPRM and KRM classical forms, applied to various target gates such as NOT, V, V+, Hadamard, and Pauli rotations, demonstrate that FPQF and KQF forms greatly reduce the gate cost of quantum multiplexers in both randomly generated data and FPRM benchmarks.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Kevin  Jin", "Tahsin  Saffat", "Marek A.

Gate-based quantum computers and Quantum Annealers (QAs) are two commercially available hardware platforms that are accessible to users today. Although promising, existing gate-based quantum computers consist of only a few dozen qubits and are not large enough for most applications. On the other hand, existing QAs with few thousand of qubits have the potential to solve some domainspecific optimization problems. QAs are single instruction machines and to execute a program, the problem is cast to a Hamiltonian, embedded on the hardware, and a single quantum machine instruction (QMI) is run. Unfortunately, noise and imperfections in hardware result in sub-optimal solutions on QAs even if the QMI is run for thousands of trials. The limited programmability of QAs mean that the user executes the same QMI for all trials. This subjects all trials to a similar noise profile throughout the execution, resulting in a systematic bias. We observe that systematic bias leads to sub-optimal solutions and cannot be alleviated by executing more trials or using existing error-mitigation schemes. To address this challenge, we propose EQUAL (Ensemble QUantum AnneaLing). EQUAL generates an ensemble of QMIs by adding controlled perturbations to the program QMI. When executed on the QA, the ensemble of QMIs steers the program away from encountering the same bias during all trials and thus, improves the quality of solutions. Our evaluations using the 2041-qubit D-Wave QA show that EQUAL bridges the difference between the baseline and the ideal by an average of 14% (and up to 26%), without requiring any additional trials. EQUAL can be combined with existing error mitigation schemes to further bridge the difference between the baseline and ideal by an average of 55% (and up to 68%).", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Ramin  Ayanzadeh", "Poulami  Das", "Swamit S.

We consider the diffusive molecular communication channel between a transmitter nano-machine and a receiver nano-machine in a fluid environment. The information molecules released by the transmitter nano-machine into the environment can degrade in the channel via a first-order degradation reaction and those that reach the receiver nano-machine can participate in a reversible bimolecular reaction with receiver receptor proteins. Thereby, we distinguish between two scenarios. In the first scenario, we assume that the entire surface of the receiver is covered by receptor molecules. We derive a closed-form analytical expression for the expected received signal at the receiver, i.e., the expected number of activated receptors on the surface of the receiver. Then, in the second scenario, we consider the case where the number of receptor molecules is finite and the uniformly distributed receptor molecules cover the receiver surface only partially. We show that the expected received signal for this scenario can be accurately approximated by the expected received signal for the first scenario after appropriately modifying the forward reaction rate constant.

The expectations for next generations on issues like throughput, range, reliability, and power consumption are even higher. This is quite a challenge considering all the work already done. Cross-layer optimization of physical (PHY) and medium access control (MAC) layers can be an interesting exploration path for further enhancement. During this thesis we have studied cross-layer optimization techniques, with a focus on the IEEE 802.11ac standard. A new multichannel aggregation scheme involving cross-knowledge between PHY and MAC layers has been proposed to improve performance in collision-prone environments. We have shown that some functionalities directly involved PHY and MAC layers. An accurate modeling of both PHY and MAC mechanisms is thus needed to have a realistic characterization of such functionalities. A cross-layer simulator, compliant with IEEE 802.11ac specifications, has thus been implemented. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first simulator incorporating detailed PHY and MAC functionalities for the IEEE 802.11ac standard. The multiple-user multiple-input, multiple-output (MU-MIMO) technique, which is one of the main innovations of the IEEE 802.11ac, needs both PHY and MAC layer considerations. We have thus used the implemented cross-layer simulator to evaluate the performance of MU-MIMO and compared it with the single-user MIMO (SU-MIMO). The aim of these studies was to evaluate the 'real' gains of MU-MIMO solutions (accounting for PHY+MAC) over SU-MIMO solutions and not the generally accepted ones. The impact of the channel sounding interval has particularly been studied.

We present a novel technique using qutrits to achieve a logarithmic depth (runtime) decomposition of the Generalized Toffoli gate using no ancilla-a significant improvement over linear depth for the best qubit-only equivalent. Our circuit construction also features a 70x improvement in two-qudit gate count over the qubit-only equivalent decomposition. This results in circuit cost reductions for important algorithms like quantum neurons and Grover search. We develop an open-source circuit simulator for qutrits, along with realistic near-term noise models which account for the cost of operating qutrits. Simulation results for these noise models indicate over 90% mean reliability (fidelity) for our circuit construction, versus under 30% for the qubit-only baseline.

Modern digital computers are physical embodiments of classical UTMs. For the most important class of problem in computer science, non-deterministic polynomial complete problems, non-deterministic UTMs (NUTMs) are theoretically exponentially faster than both classical UTMs and quantum mechanical UTMs (QUTMs). However, no attempt has previously been made to build an NUTM, and their construction has been regarded as impossible. Here, we demonstrate the first physical design of an NUTM. This design is based on Thue string rewriting systems, and thereby avoids the limitations of most previous DNA computing schemes: all the computation is local (simple edits to strings) so there is no need for communication, and there is no need to order operations. The design exploits DNA's ability to replicate to execute an exponential number of computational paths in P time. Each Thue rewriting step is embodied in a DNA edit implemented using a novel combination of polymerase chain reactions and site-directed mutagenesis. We demonstrate that the design works using both computational modelling and in vitro molecular biology experimentation: the design is thermodynamically favourable, microprogramming can be used to encode arbitrary Thue rules, all classes of Thue rule can be implemented, and non-deterministic rule implementation. In an NUTM, the resource limitation is space, which contrasts with classical UTMs and QUTMs where it is time. This fundamental difference enables an NUTM to trade space for time, which is significant for both theoretical computer science and physics. It is also of practical importance, for to quote Richard Feynman \u2018there's plenty of room at the bottom\u2019.

Although adopting different IRS phase shifts for DL WPT and UL WIT, i.e., dynamic IRS beamforming, is in principle possible but incurs additional signaling overhead and computational complexity, it is an open problem whether it is actually beneficial. To answer this question, we consider an IRS-assisted WPCN where multiple devices employ a hybrid access point (HAP) to first harvest energy and then transmit information using non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). Specifically, we aim to maximize the sum throughput of all devices by jointly optimizing the IRS phase shifts and the resource allocation.

We have demonstrated that the impact of (1) retention degradation due to the oxide thickness scaling, (2) process variation, and (3) flicker noise can be abated in ferroelectric FinFET based binary neural networks, which exhibits superior performance over quaternary and analog neural network, amidst all variations. The performance of a neural network is the result of coalesced performance of device, architecture and algorithm.

Amidst many developments the research on the feasibility of implementing neural networks on hardware and the quest for finding a perfect synaptic device is still on.

Pronounced ferroelectricity in single layer thin film of hafnium zirconium oxide (HZO)[17], fast switching, high on/off ratio, excellent linearity in analog synaptic weight updates, bidirectional operation and good endurance are the key technological factors, which makes ferroelectric field effect transistors (FE-FET) superior to phase change memory, resistive memory and magnetic memories for synaptic devices. However, it is well-known that the device to device variations in FE-FETs increases with scaling[18] and the switching becomes stochastic, which inhibits reliable program and erase method in deeply scaled FE-FETs.

In these scenarios, because of the lack of mathematical channel models, a completely new approach to design and analysis is required. In this work, we focus on one important aspect of communication systems, the detection algorithms, and demonstrate that by borrowing tools from deep learning, it is possible to train detectors that perform well, without any knowledge of the underlying channel models. We evaluate these algorithms using experimental data that is collected by a chemical communication platform, where the channel model is unknown and difficult to model analytically.

The operation scheduling, placement, and qubit routing problems tackled by the quantum physical mapper are highly dependent on one another. More precisely, the scheduling solution affects the quality of the achievable placement solution due to resource pressures that may be created as a result of operation scheduling, whereas the operation placement and qubit routing solutions influence the scheduling solution due to resulting distances between predecessor and current operations, which in turn determines routing latencies. The proposed flow for the quantum physical mapper captures these dependencies by applying (1) a loose scheduling step, which transforms an initial quantum data flow graph into one that explicitly captures the no-cloning theorem of the quantum computing and then performs instruction scheduling based on a modified force-directed scheduling approach to minimize the resource contention and quantum circuit latency, (2) a placement step, which uses timing-driven instruction placement to minimize the approximate routing latencies while making iterative calls to the aforesaid force-directed scheduler to correct scheduling levels of quantum operations as needed, and (3) a routing step that finds dynamic values of routing latencies for the qubits. In addition to the quantum physical mapper, an approach is presented to determine the single best ULB size for a target quantum circuit by examining the latency of different FT quantum operations mapped onto different ULB sizes and using information about the occurrence frequency of operations on critical paths of the target quantum algorithm to weigh these latencies.

In this paper, we prove that there exists a 3D tile set in the 2HAM which is intrinsically universal for the class of all 2D STAM+ systems at temperature 1 and 2 where the STAM+ does not make use of the STAM's power of glue deactivation and assembly breaking, as the tile components of the 2HAM are static and unable to change or break bonds. This means that there is a single tile set U in the 3D 2HAM which can, for an arbitrarily complex STAM+ system S, be configured with a single input configuration which causes U to exactly simulate S at a scale factor dependent upon S. Furthermore, this simulation uses only 2 planes of the third dimension. \n \nTo achieve this result, we also demonstrate useful techniques and transformations for converting an arbitrarily complex STAM+ tile set into an STAM+ tile set where every tile has a constant, low amount of complexity, in terms of the number and types of \"signals\" they can send, with a trade off in scale factor. \n \nWhile the first result is of more theoretical interest, showing the power of static tiles to simulate dynamic tiles when given one extra plane in 3D, the second is of more practical interest for the experimental implementation of STAM tiles, since it provides potentially useful strategies for developing powerful STAM systems while keeping the complexity of individual tiles low, thus making them easier to physically implement.", "venue": "DNA", "authors": ["Jacob  Hendricks", "Jennifer E.

The memristor based implementation of InAmp design has an improved gain. The advantages of memristor application are shown, and DC and operation gain range are discussed in this paper. Furthermore, variability analysis and performance variation with respect to the temperature variation is provided. In addition, the noise sensitivity analysis is performed.

One such approach is to use a low barrier nanomagnet as the free layer of a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) whose magnetic fluctuations are converted to resistance fluctuations in the presence of a stable fixed layer. Here, we propose and theoretically analyze a magnetic tunnel junction with no fixed layers but two free layers that are circularly shaped disk magnets. We use an experimentally benchmarked model that accounts for finite temperature magnetization dynamics, bias-dependent charge and spin-polarized currents as well as the dipolar coupling between the free layers. We obtain analytical results for statistical averages of fluctuations that are in good agreement with the numerical model. We find that the free layers at low dimensions fluctuate to randomize the resistance of the MTJ in an approximately bias-independent manner. We show how such MTJs can be used to build a binary stochastic neuron (or a p-bit) in hardware. Unlike earlier stochastic MTJs that need to operate at a specific bias point to produce random fluctuations, the proposed design can be random for a wide range of bias values, independent of spin-transfer-torque pinning. Moreover, in the absence of a carefully optimized stabled fixed layer, the symmetric double-free layer stack can be manufactured using present day Magnetoresistive Random Access Memory (MRAM) technology by minimal changes to the fabrication process.

However, the degree of device mismatch in analog mixed-signal neuromorphic circuits renders the use of pre-trained EBNs challenging, if not impossible. To overcome this issue, we developed a novel local learning rule suitable for on-chip implementation that drives a randomly connected network of spiking neurons into a tightly balanced regime.

Our proposed method paves the way towards a system-level implementation of tightly balanced networks on analog mixed-signal neuromorphic hardware.

We discuss the conditions under which the proposed machine leads to a pure polariton simulator with pre-programmed couplings or results in a hybrid classical polariton simulator.

QCA-based exclusive-OR (XOR) gates are frequently used in the construction of several computing subsystems such as adders, linear feedback shift registers, parity generators and checkers. However, none of the existing designs for QCA XOR gates have considered the issue of ensuring fault-tolerance. Simulation results also show that these designs can hardly tolerate any fault. We investigate the applicability of various existing fault-tolerant schemes such as triple modular redundancy, NAND multiplexing and majority multiplexing in the context of practical realization of QCA XOR gate.

In our recent studies, we have shown that Pleurotus oyster fungi generate electrical potential impulses in the form of spike events in response to their exposure to environmental, mechanical, and chemical triggers, suggesting that the nature of stimuli may be deduced from the fungal electrical responses. In this study, we explored the communication protocols of fungi as reporters of human chemical secretions such as hormones, addressing whether fungi can sense human signals. We exposed Pleurotus oyster fungi to hydrocortisone, which was directly applied to the surface of a fungal-colonized hemp shavings substrate, and recorded the electrical activity of the fungi. Hydrocortisone is a medicinal hormone replacement that is similar to the natural stress hormone cortisol. Changes in cortisol levels released by the body indicate the presence of disease and can have a detrimental effect on physiological process regulation. The response of fungi to hydrocortisone was also explored further using X-rays to reveal changes in the fungi tissue, where receiving hydrocortisone by the substrate can inhibit the flow of calcium and, as a result, reduce its physiological changes. This research could open the way for future studies on adaptive fungal wearables capable of detecting human physiological states and biosensors built of living fungi.", "venue": "ACS biomaterials science & engineering", "authors": ["Mohammad Mahdi Dehshibi", "Alessandro  Chiolerio", "Anna  Nikolaidou", "Richard  Mayne", "Antoni  Gandia", "Mona  Ashtari", "Andrew  Adamatzky"], "year": 2021, "n_citations": 0}

Furthermore, the increasing number of cores is placing a huge performance burden on the network-on-chip (NoC) infrastructure. While NoCs are designed as regular architectures that allow scaling to hundreds of cores, the lack of a flexible topology gives rise to higher latencies, lower throughput, and increased energy costs. In this paper, we explore MorphoNoCs - scalable, configurable, hybrid NoCs obtained by extending regular electrical networks with configurable nanophotonic links. In order to design MorphoNoCs, we first carry out a detailed study of the design space for Multi-Write Multi-Read (MWMR) nanophotonics links. After identifying optimum design points, we then discuss the router architecture for deploying them in hybrid electronic-photonic NoCs. We then study the design space at the network level, by varying the waveguide lengths and the number of hybrid routers. This affords us to carry out energy-latency trade-offs. For our evaluations, we adopt traces from synthetic benchmarks as well as the NAS Parallel Benchmark suite. Our results indicate that MorphoNoCs can achieve latency improvements of up to 3.0\u00d7 or energy improvements of up to 1.37\u00d7 over the base electronic network.", "venue": "Microprocess.

Before solving a problem on D-Wave, several pre-processing methods can be applied, one of them being the so-called spin reversal or gauge transform. The spin reversal transform flips the sign of selected variables and coefficients of the Ising or QUBO (quadratic unconstrained binary optimization) representation of the problem that D-Wave minimizes. The spin reversal transform leaves the ground state of the Ising model invariant, but can average out the biases induced through analog and systematic errors on the device, thus improving the quality of the solution that D-Wave returns. This work investigates the effectiveness of the spin reversal transform for D-Wave 2000Q. We consider two important NP-hard problems, the Maximum Clique and the Minimum Vertex Cover problems, and show on a variety of input problem graphs that using the spin reversal transform can yield substantial improvements in solution quality. In contrast to the native spin reversal built into D-Wave, we consider more general ways to reverse individual spins and we investigate the dependence on the problem type, on the spin reversal probability, and possible advantages of carrying out reversals on the qubit instead of the chain level. Most importantly, for a given individual problem, we use our findings to optimize the spin reversal transform using a genetic optimization algorithm.", "venue": "2019 IEEE International Conference on Rebooting Computing (ICRC)", "authors": ["Elijah  Pelofske", "Georg  Hahn", "Hristo  Djidjev"], "year": 2019, "n_citations": 16}

Unlike rate distortion codes, which guarantee a bound on the expected value of channel distortion, the probabilistic VDB codes we present guarantee any desired tail distribution on integer distances of words transmitted over a channel. We extend prior work to present tighter upper bounds on the efficiency for VDB codes.

Considering this setup, the joint distribution of the molecules on the circular absorbing receiver with respect to time and angle is derived. Using this distribution, the channel characteristics are examined. Then, we extend this channel model to 3-D using a cylindrical receiver and investigate the channel properties.

This phenomenon can be used in neuromorphic systems to compensate for slowly changing conditions or chronic shifts in the system configuration. However, to avoid interference with other adaptation or learning processes active in the neuromorphic system, it is important that the homeostatic plasticity mechanism operates on time scales that are much longer than conventional synaptic plasticity ones. In this paper we present an ultralow leakage circuit, integrated into an automatic gain control scheme, that can implement the synaptic scaling homeostatic process over extremely long time scales. Synaptic scaling consists in globally scaling the synaptic weights of all synapses impinging onto a neuron maintaining their relative differences, to preserve the effects of learning. The scheme we propose controls the global gain of analog log-domain synapse circuits to keep the neuron's average firing rate constant around a set operating point, over extremely long time scales.

Despite tremendous strides in scaling the ubiquitous metal-oxide-semiconductor transistor, the underlying von-Neumann computing architecture has remained unchanged. The limited throughput and energy-efficiency of the state-of-the-art computing systems, to a large extent, result from the well-known von-Neumann bottleneck. The energy and throughput inefficiency of the von-Neumann machines have been accentuated in recent times due to the present emphasis on data-intensive applications such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and cryptography. A possible approach towards mitigating the overhead associated with the von-Neumann bottleneck is to enable in-memory Boolean computations. In this paper, we present an augmented version of the conventional SRAM bit-cells, called the X-SRAM, with the ability to perform in-memory, vector Boolean computations, in addition to the usual memory storage operations. We propose at least six different schemes for enabling in-memory vector computations, including NAND, NOR, IMP (implication), XOR logic gates, with respect to different bit-cell topologies \u2212 the 8T cell and the 8+T Differential cell.

As an illustration, we also present the efficacy of the proposed in-memory computations by implementing advanced encryption standard algorithm on a non-standard von-Neumann machine wherein the conventional SRAM is replaced by X-SRAM.

In this paper we present a spiking neural network architecture that supports the use of memristive devices as synaptic elements and propose mixed-signal analog-digital interfacing circuits that mitigate the effect of variability in their conductance values and exploit their variability in the switching threshold for implementing stochastic learning. The effect of device variability is mitigated using pairs of memristive devices configured in a complementary push-pull mechanism and interfaced to a current-mode normalizer circuit. The stochastic learning mechanism is obtained by mapping the desired change in synaptic weight into a corresponding switching probability that is derived from the intrinsic stochastic behavior of memristive devices.

This spatiotemporal dynamics realizes a rich reservoir-computational functionality. First, we simulate spin waves in a rectangular garnet film with two input electrodes to obtain spatial distributions of the reservoir states in response to input signals, which are represented as spin vectors and used for a machine-learning waveform classification task. The detected reservoir states are combined through readout connection weights to generate a final output. We visualize the spatial distribution of the weights after training to discuss the number and positions of the output electrodes by arranging them at grid points, equiangularly circular points or at random. We evaluate the classification accuracy by changing the number of the output electrodes, and find that a high accuracy (>90%) is achieved with only several tens of output electrodes regardless of grid, circular or random arrangement. These results suggest that the spin waves possess sufficiently complex and rich dynamics for this type of tasks.

This raises the question, if recent embedding heuristics can maintain meaningful embedding performance on hardware graphs of increasing size. Here, we develop an improved version of the probabilistic-swap-shift-annealing (PSSA) embedding heuristic [which has recently been demonstrated to outperform the standard embedding heuristic by D-Wave Systems (Cai et al., 2014)] and evaluate its embedding performance on hardware graphs of increasing size. For random-cubic and Barabasi-Albert graphs we find the embedding performance of improved PSSA to consistently exceed the threshold of the best known complete graph embedding by a factor of 3.2 and 2.8, respectively, up to hardware graphs with 102,400 nodes. On the other hand, for random graphs with constant edge density not even improved PSSA can overcome the deterministic threshold guaranteed by the existence of the best known complete graph embedding.

Modern facilities offer a range of automated systems to guide residents towards emergency exists. The systems are assumed to be infallible. But what if they fail? How occupants not familiar with a building layout will be looking for exits in case of very limited visibility where tactile sensing is the only way to assess the environment? Analogous models of human behaviour, and socio-dynamics in general, are provided to be fruitful ways to explore alternative, or would-be scenarios. Crowd, or a single person, dynamics could be imitated using particle systems, reaction-diffusion chemical medium, electro-magnetic fields, or social insects. Each type of analogous model offer unique insights on behavioural patterns of natural systems in constrained geometries. In this particular paper we have chosen leeches to analyse patterns of exploration. Reasons are two-fold. First, when deprived from other stimuli leeches change their behavioural modes in an automated regime in response to mechanical stimulation. Therefore leeches can give us invaluable information on how human beings might behave under stress and limited visibility. Second, leeches are ideal blueprints of future soft-bodied rescue robots. Leeches have modular nervous circuitry with a rich behavioral spectrum. Leeches are multi-functional, fault-tolerant with autonomous inter-segment coordination and adaptive decision-making.

In this paper, we present an asymptotic closed-form expression for the mutual information of a multi-antenna transmitter-receiver pair in the presence of multiple RISs, in the large-antenna limit, using the random matrix and replica theories. Under mild assumptions, asymptotic expressions for the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of the channel covariance matrices are derived. We find that, when the channel close to an RIS is correlated, for instance due to small angle spread, the communication link benefits significantly from the RIS optimization, resulting in gains that are surprisingly higher than the nearly uncorrelated case. Furthermore, when the desired reflection from the RIS departs significantly from geometrical optics, the surface can be optimized to provide robust communication links.

Logic locking/encryption and layout camouflaging are two prominent techniques for IP protection. Most existing approaches, however, particularly those focused on CMOS integration, incur excessive design overheads resulting from their need for additional circuit structures or device-level modifications. This work leverages the innate polymorphism of an emerging spin-based device, called the giant spin-Hall effect (GSHE) switch, to simultaneously enable locking and camouflaging within a single instance. Using the GSHE switch, we propose a powerful primitive that enables cloaking all the 16 Boolean functions possible for two inputs. We conduct a comprehensive study using state-of-the-art Boolean satisfiability (SAT) attacks to demonstrate the superior resilience of the proposed primitive in comparison to several others in the literature. While we tailor the primitive for deterministic computation, it can readily support stochastic computation; we argue that stochastic behavior can break most, if not all, existing SAT attacks. Finally, we discuss the resilience of the primitive against various side-channel attacks as well as invasive monitoring at runtime, which are arguably even more concerning threats than SAT attacks.", "venue": "2018 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition (DATE)", "authors": ["Satwik  Patnaik", "Nikhil  Rangarajan", "Johann  Knechtel", "Ozgur  Sinanoglu", "Shaloo  Rakheja"], "year": 2018, "n_citations": 23}

Therefore, replacing eFlash with STTRAM is desirable in IoTs for power-efficiency. Although promising, STTRAM brings several new security and privacy challenges that pose a significant threat to sensitive data in memory. This is inevitable due to the underlying dependency of this memory technology on environmental parameters such as temperature and magnetic fields that can be exploited by an adversary to tamper with the program and data.

In this work, we propose an All-Spin Artificial Neural Network where a single spintronic device acts as the basic building block of the system. The device offers a direct mapping to synapse and neuron functionalities in the brain while inter-layer network communication is accomplished via CMOS transistors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a neural architecture where a single nanoelectronic device is able to mimic both neurons and synapses. The ultra-low voltage operation of low resistance magneto-metallic neurons enables the low-voltage operation of the array of spintronic synapses, thereby leading to ultra-low power neural architectures.

We present an approach for encoding integer variables into binary ones, thereby representing unconstrained integer quadratic programming problems as unconstrained binary quadratic programming problems.

Conventional computing devices are based on irreversible logic and further reduction in power consumption and/or increase in speed appears non-promising. Reversible computing has emerged as a solution looking to the power and speed requirements of future computing devices. In reversible computing logic gates used are such that input can be generated by reversing the operation from output. A number of reversible combinational circuits have been developed but the growth of sequential circuits was not significant due to feedback and fanout was not allowed. However, allowing feedback in space, a very few sequential logic blocks i.e. flip-flops have been reported in literature. In order to develop sequential circuits, flip-flops are used in conventional circuits. Also good circuit design methods, optimized and fault tolerant designs are also needed to build large, complex and reliable circuits in conventional computing. Reversible flip-flops are the basic memory elements that will be the building block of memory for reversible computing and quantum computing devices. In this dissertation we plan to address above issues. First we have proposed a Pareek gate suitable for low-cost flip-flops design and then design methodology to develop flip-flops are illustrated. Further almost all flip-flops and some example circuit have been developed and finally these circuits have been converted into fault tolerant circuits by preserving their parity and designs of offline as well as online testable circuits have been proposed.

However, utilizing multi-bit HVs allows HDC to achieve acceptable accuracies in lower dimensions which in turn leads to higher energy efficiencies.

This is accomplished by a differential threshold logic gate (TLG). A TLG with n inputs implements a subset of Boolean functions of n variables that are linear threshold functions. The output of such a gate is one if and only if an integer weighted linear arithmetic sum of the inputs equals or exceeds a given integer threshold. We present a novel architecture of a TLG that not only allows a single TLG to implement a large number of complex logic functions, which would require multiple levels of logic when implemented using conventional logic primitives, but also allows the selection of that subset of functions by assignment of the transistor threshold voltages to the input transistors. To obfuscate the functionality of the TLG, weights of some inputs are set to zero by setting their device threshold to be a high Vt. The threshold voltage of the remaining transistors is set to low Vt to increase their transconductance. The number of low Vt transistors whose gates are driven by a given input xi determines the weight of that input. The function of a TLG is not determined by the cell itself but rather the signals that are connected to its inputs. This makes it possible to hide the support set of the function by essentially removing some variable from the support set of the function. This is done by selective assignment of high and low Vt to the input transistors. We describe how a standard cell library of TLGs can be mixed with conventional standard cells to realize complex logic circuits, whose function can never be discovered by reverse engineering.

It is of particular interest to develop an SOT-MRAM device with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) in order to leverage the greater density and thermal stability achievable with PMA as opposed to in-plane magnetic anisotropy. However, the orthogonality between SOT and PMA prevents deterministic directional switching without an additional device component that breaks the symmetry, such as an external magnetic field or complex physical structure; not only do these components complicate fabrication, they also are not robust to variations in fabrication and applied switching current. Following previous work demonstrating toggle SOT switching of ferromagnetic layers, this article, therefore, proposes a simple SOT-MRAM structure with PMA in which deterministic toggle switching is achieved without requiring additional device components. Furthermore, this toggle PMA SOT-MRAM is shown to be far more robust than previous approaches for directional PMA SOT-MRAM, with no maximum current pulse duration and greater than 50% tolerance to applied switching current magnitude. This article describes the physical structure and toggle switching mechanism, provides micromagnetic simulations demonstrating its feasibility, and evaluates the robustness and tolerance to material parameters to guide the fabrication of optimized devices that will jumpstart the third generation of MRAM.", "venue": "IEEE Journal on Exploratory Solid-State Computational Devices and Circuits", "authors": ["Naimul  Hassan", "Susana P.

A number of such Bayesian models have been shown to account efficiently for perceptive and behavioral tasks. However , little is known about the way these subjective probabilities are represented and processed in the brain. Several theoretical proposals have been made , from large populations of neurons to specialized cortical microcircuits or individual neurons as potential substrates for such subjective probabilistic inferences. In contrast , we propose in this paper that at a subcellular level , biochemical cascades of cell signaling can perform the necessary probabilistic computations. Specifically , we propose that macromolecular assemblies (receptors , ionic channels , and allosteric enzymes) coupled through several diffusible messengers (G-proteins , cytoplasmic calcium , cyclic nucleotides and other second messengers , membrane potentials , and neurotransmitters) are the biochemical substrates for subjective probability evaluation and updating. On one hand , the messengers ' concentrations play the role of parameters encoding probability distributions ; on the other hand , allosteric conformational changes compute the probabilistic inferences. The method used to support this thesis is to prove that both subjective cognitive probabilistic models and the descriptive coupled Markov chains used to model these biochemical cascades are performing equivalent computations. On one hand , we demonstrate that Bayesian inference on subjective models is equivalent to the computation of some rational function with nonnegative coefficient (RFNC) , and , on the other hand , that biochemical cascades may also be seen as computing RFNCs. This suggests that the ability to perform probabilistic reasoning is a very fundamental characteristic of biological systems , from unicellular organisms to the most complex brains. Living organisms survive and multiply even though they have uncertain and incomplete information about their environment and imperfect models to predict the consequences of their actions. Bayesian models have been proposed to face this challenge. Indeed , Bayesian inference is a way to do optimal reasoning when only uncertain and incomplete information is available. Various perceptive , sensory-motor , and cognitive functions have been successfully modeled this way. However , the biological mechanisms allowing animals and humans to represent and to compute probability distributions are not known. It has been proposed that neurons and assemblies of neurons could be the appropriate scale to search for clues to probabilistic reasoning. In contrast , in this paper , we propose that interacting populations of macromolecules and diffusible messengers can perform probabilistic computation. This suggests that probabilistic reasoning , based on cellular signaling pathways , is a fundamental skill of living organisms available to the simplest unicellular organisms as well as the most complex brains .", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Jacques  Droulez", "David  Colliaux", "Audrey  Houillon", "Pierre  Bessi\u00e8re"], "year": 2015, "n_citations": 3}

This yellow slime mould forages for foodstuffs, extending protoplasmic tubes by a process of shuttle streaming. The cell is capable of optimising the shape of its protoplasmic networks in spatial configurations of attractants and repellents, resulting in spanning-tree arrangements. Such adaptive behaviour can be interpreted as computation. When exposed to attractants and repellents, Physarum changes patterns of its electrical activity associated with shuttle streaming, creating a peristaltic like action within the tubes, forcing cytoplasm along the lumen; the frequency of this oscillation determines the speed and direction of growth. We experimentally derived a unique one-to-one mapping between a range of selected bioactive chemicals and the resultant oscillation voltage of the slime mould\u2019s extracellular electrical potential [1]. Amplitude and frequency change of this fluctuation can be used to identify specific chemicals with acceptable reliability; demonstrating detection of these chemicals in a similar manner to a biological contactless chemical sensor. The organism took approximately 10 minutes to respond fully to chemical exposure; in addition, 10 minutes of voltage recording was necessary to deduce frequency change. We believe results could be used in future designs of slime mould based chemical sensors and computers. Surface electrical potential recordings were also made of a protoplasmic tube of the slime mould in response to a multitude of stimuli with regards to sensory fusion or multisensory integration and also to evaluate the effect of environmental fluctuations on the reliability of chemical detection [2]. Each stimulus was tested both alone and in combination to evaluate the effect that multiple stimuli have on the frequency of streaming oscillation. White light caused a decrease in frequency, whilst increasing the temperature and applying a food source in the form of oat flakes both increased the frequency. Simultaneously stimulating P. polycephalum with light and oat flake produced no net change in frequency, while combined light and heat stimuli showed an increase in frequency smaller than that observed for heat alone. When the two positive stimuli, oat flakes and heat, were combined, there was an overall increase in frequency similar to the cumulative increases caused by the individual stimuli. It is not known if Physarum polycephalum is able to differentiate between these different stimuli, but it is believed that the stimuli are detected by specific receptors and the effects are mediated through a multiple input, single output biochemical pathway resulting in sensory integration with amplitude and frequency of shuttle streaming. It is plausible that the calcium fluctuations responsible for shuttle streaming are the result of competitive or inhibitory binding of a bio-oscillator by receptor intermediaries. The chemical biosensor does exhibit sensitivity to significant environmental changes such as increased light levels and large changes in temperature which may interfere with the voltage fluctuation and hence accuracy of analyte detection.

Palimpsest consolidation is facilitated by the interaction of hidden biochemical processes that govern synaptic efficacy during varying lifetimes. This arrangement allows idle memories to be temporarily overwritten without being forgotten, in favour of new memories utilised in the short-term. While embedded artificial intelligence can greatly benefit from such functionality, a practical demonstration in hardware is still missing. Here, we show how the intrinsic properties of metal-oxide volatile memristors emulate the hidden processes that support biological palimpsest consolidation. Our memristive synapses exhibit an expanded doubled capacity which can protect a consolidated long-term memory while up to hundreds of uncorrelated short-term memories temporarily overwrite it. The synapses can also implement familiarity detection of previously forgotten memories. Crucially, palimpsest operation is achieved automatically and without the need for specialised instructions. We further demonstrate a practical adaptation of this technology in the context of image vision.

We propose the design and optimization of a high-performance, area-and energy-efficient ReRAM-based hardware accelerator to achieve robust DNN inferencing in the presence of stochastic noise. We make two key technical contributions. First, we propose a stochastic-noise-aware training method, referred to as ReSNA, to improve the accuracy of DNN inferencing on ReRAM crossbars with stochastic noise. Second, we propose an information-theoretic algorithm, referred to as CF-MESMO, to identify the Pareto set of solutions to trade-off multiple objectives, including inferencing accuracy, area overhead, execution time, and energy consumption. The main challenge in this context is that executing the ReSNA method to evaluate each candidate ReRAM design is prohibitive. To address this challenge, we utilize the continuous-fidelity evaluation of ReRAM designs associated with prohibitive high computation cost by varying the number of training epochs to trade-off accuracy and cost. CF-MESMO iteratively selects the candidate ReRAM design and fidelity pair that maximizes the information gained per unit computation cost about the optimal Pareto front. Our experiments on benchmark DNNs show that the proposed algorithms efficiently uncover high-quality Pareto fronts.

The former attribute results in high energy efficiency (compared to the Giant-Spin Hall (GSH) effect-based devices with in-plane magnetic anisotropy magnets). The latter feature leads to a compact access-transistor-less memory array design.

We show that BHTN can be calculated as a sequence of optimization problems suitable for the D-Wave 2000Q quantum annealer. Although current technology is still fairly restricted in the problems they can address, we show that a complex problem such as BHTN can be solved efficiently and accurately.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Elijah  Pelofske", "Georg  Hahn", "Daniel  O'Malley", "Hristo N.

As the impact of parasitic resistances and capacitances continues to increase with dimensional downscaling, component-level optimization alone becomes insufficient, calling for a holistic assessment and optimization methodology across the boundaries between devices, interconnects, circuits, and systems. The physical implementation flow in DISPEL enables realistic analysis of complex wires and vias in VLSI systems and their impact on the chip power, speed, and area, which simple circuit simulations cannot capture. To demonstrate the use of DISPEL, a 32-bit commercial processor core is implemented using theoretical n-type MoS2 and p-type Black Phosphorous (BP) planar FETs at a projected 5-nm node, and the performance is benchmarked against Si FinFETs. While the superior gate control of the MoS2/BP FETs can theoretically provide 51% reduction in the isofrequency energy consumption, the actual performance can be greatly limited by the source/drain contact resistances. With the large amount of data generated by DISPEL, a neural-network is trained to predict the key performance metrics of the 32-bit processor core using the characteristics of transistors and interconnects as the input features without the need to go through the time-consuming physical implementation flow.

However, the imprecise properties of existing memristor devices generally result in catastrophic failures for the network in-situ training, which significantly impedes their engineering applications. In this work, we design a novel learning scheme that integrates stochastic sparse updating with momentum adaption (SSM) to efficiently train the imprecise memristor networks with high classification accuracy. The SSM scheme consists of: (1) a stochastic and discrete learning method to make weight updates sparse; (2) a momentum based gradient algorithm to eliminate training noises and distill robust updates; (3) a network re-initialization method to mitigate the device-to-device variation; (4) an update compensation strategy to further stabilize the weight programming process. With the SSM scheme, experiments show that the classification accuracy on multilayer perceptron (MLP) and convolutional neural network (CNN) improves from 26.12% to 90.07% and from 65.98% to 92.38%, respectively.

Fortunately, these algorithms also tend to contain a small number of repetitively-used quantum kernels. Identifying the quantum logic blocks that implement such quantum kernels is critical to the complexity management for realizing the corresponding quantum circuit. Moreover, quantum computation requires some type of quantum error correction coding to combat decoherence, which in turn results in a large number of ancilla qubits in the circuit. Sharing the ancilla qubits among quantum operations (even though this sharing can increase the overall circuit latency) is important in order to curb the resource demand of the quantum algorithm. This paper presents a multi-core reconfigurable quantum processor architecture, called Requp, which supports a layered approach to mapping a quantum algorithm and ancilla sharing. More precisely, a scalable quantum mapper, called Squash, is introduced, which divides a given quantum circuit into a number of quantum kernels--each kernel comprises k parts such that each part will run on exactly one of k available cores.

Our experiments show that memristor networks natively spike and can exhibit emergent oscillations and bursting spikes. Networks of near-ideal memristors exhibit behaviour similar to a single memristor and combine in circuits like resistors do. Spiking is more likely when filamentary memristors are used or the circuits have a higher degree of compositional complexity (i.e. a larger number of anti-series or anti-parallel interactions). 3-memristor circuits with the same memristor polarity (low compositional complexity) are stabilised and do not show spiking behaviour. 3-memristor circuits with anti-series and/or anti-parallel compositions show richer and more complex dynamics than 2-memristor spiking circuits.

However, the physical modeling of synaptic MC is complicated by the possible saturation of the molecular receiver caused by the competition of neurotransmitters (NTs) for postsynaptic receptors. Receiver saturation renders the system behavior nonlinear in the number of released NTs and is commonly neglected in existing analytical models. Furthermore, due to the ligands\u2019 competition for receptors (and vice versa), the individual binding events at the molecular receiver are in general not statistically independent and the commonly used binomial model for the statistics of the received signal does not apply. Hence, in this work, we propose a novel deterministic model for receptor saturation in terms of a state-space description based on an eigenfunction expansion of Fick\u2019s diffusion equation. The presented solution is numerically stable and computationally efficient. Employing the proposed deterministic model, we show that saturation at the molecular receiver effectively reduces the peak-value of the expected received signal and accelerates the clearance of NTs as compared to the case when receptor occupancy is neglected. We further derive a statistical model for the received signal in terms of the hypergeometric distribution which accounts for the competition of NTs for receptors and the competition of receptors for NTs. The proposed statistical model reveals how the signal statistics are shaped by the number of released NTs, the number of receptors, and the binding kinetics of the receptors, respectively, in the presence of competition. In particular, we show that the impact of these parameters on the signal variance is qualitatively different depending on the relative numbers of NTs and receptors. Finally, the accuracy of the proposed deterministic and statistical models is verified by particle-based computer simulations.", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on NanoBioscience", "authors": ["Sebastian  Lotter", "Maximilian  Schafer", "Johannes  Zeitler", "Robert  Schober"], "year": 2021, "n_citations": 3}

In this work, first, we introduce and empirically determine two new specifications for a resistive random-access memory (RRAM) based synapse: number of conductance levels per synapse and learning-rate. To the best of our knowledge, there are no RRAMs that meet the latter specification. As a solution, we propose the use of multiple RRAMs in parallel within a synapse. While synaptic reading, all RRAMs are simultaneously read and for each synaptic conductance-change event, the mechanism for conductance STDP is initiated on only one RRAM, randomly picked from the set.

However, resilience research struggles to come up with useful abstract programming models for reasoning about SDC. Existing work randomly flips bits in running applications, but this only shows average-case behavior for a low-level, artificial hardware model. Algorithm developers need to understand worst-case behavior with the higher-level data types they actually use, in order to make their algorithms more resilient. Also, we know so little about how SDC may manifest in future hardware, that it seems premature to draw conclusions about the average case. We argue instead that numerical algorithms can benefit from a numerical unreliability fault model, where faults manifest as unbounded perturbations to floating-point data. Algorithms can use inexpensive \"sanity\" checks that bound or exclude error in the results of computations. Given a selective reliability programming model that requires reliability only when and where needed, such checks can make algorithms reliable despite unbounded faults.

Engineering such molecular computing systems is a major challenge for synthetic biology and related fields. The chemical reaction network (CRN) model idealizes chemical interactions, abstracting away specifics of the molecular implementation, and allowing rigorous reasoning about the computational power of chemical kinetics. Here we focus on function computation with CRNs, where we think of the initial concentrations of some species as the input and the eventual steady-state concentration of another species as the output. Specifically, we are concerned with CRNs that are rate-independent (the computation must be correct independent of the reaction rate law) and composable (\\(f \\circ g\\) can be computed by concatenating the CRNs computing f and g). Rate independence and composability are important engineering desiderata, permitting implementations that violate mass-action kinetics, or even \u201cwell-mixedness\u201d, and allowing the systematic construction of complex computation via modular design. We show that to construct composable rate-independent CRNs, it is necessary and sufficient to ensure that the output species of a module is not a reactant in any reaction within the module. We then exactly characterize the functions computable by such CRNs as superadditive, positive-continuous, and piecewise rational linear.

The utilisation of integrated photonics in neural networks offers a promising alternative approach to microelectronic and hybrid optical-electronic implementations due to improvements in computational speed and low energy consumption in machine-learning tasks. However, at present, most of the neural network hardware systems are still electronic-based due to a lack of optical realisation of the nonlinear activation function. Here, we experimentally demonstrate two novel approaches for implementing an all-optical neural nonlinear activation function based on utilising unique light-matter interactions in 2D Ti3C2Tx (MXene) in the infrared (IR) range in two configurations: 1) a saturable absorber made of MXene thin film, and 2) a silicon waveguide with MXene flakes overlayer. These configurations may serve as nonlinear units in photonic neural networks, while their nonlinear transfer function can be flexibly designed to optimise the performance of different neuromorphic tasks, depending on the operating wavelength.

The goal is to provide a framework accommodating such reductions in a global manner and without any loss of generality in the working assumptions; specifically, we avoid global hypotheses imposing the existence of a classical circuit variable controlling each device. Classical (voltage/current but also flux/charge) models are easily obtained as particular cases of a general homogeneous model. Our approach extends the results introduced for linear circuits in a previous paper, by means of a systematic use of global parametrizations of smooth planar curves. This makes it possible to formulate reduced models in terms of homogeneous variables also in the nonlinear context: contrary to voltages and currents (and also to fluxes and charges), homogeneous variables qualify as state variables for smooth, uncoupled circuits without any restriction on the characteristics of devices. The inherent symmetry of this formalism makes it possible to address in broad generality certain analytical problems in nonlinear circuit theory, such as the state-space problem and related issues involving impasse phenomena.

Moreover P systems, including SNP systems, are inherently and maximally parallel computing models whose inspirations are taken from the functioning and dynamics of a living cell. In particular, SNP systems try to give a modest but formal representation of a special type of cell known as the neuron and their interactions with one another. The nature of SNP systems allowed their representation as matrices, which is a crucial step in simulating them on highly parallel devices such as GPUs. The highly parallel nature of SNP systems necessitate the use of hardware intended for parallel computations. The simulation algorithms, design considerations, and implementation are presented.

ALM, which is in essence an adaptive fuzzy learning method, models a Multi-Input Single-Output (MISO) system with several Single-Input Single-Output (SISO) subsystems. Ink Drop Spread (IDS) operator, which is the main processing engine of this method, extracts useful features from the data without complicated computations and provides stability and convergence as well. Despite great performance of ALM in applications such as classification, clustering, and modelling, an efficient hardware implementation has remained a challenging problem. Large amount of memory required to store the information of IDS planes as well as the high computational cost of the IDS computing system are two main barriers to ALM becoming more popular. In this paper, a novel learning method is proposed based on the idea of IDS, but with a novel approach that eliminates the computational cost of IDS operator. Unlike traditional approaches, our proposed method finds functions to describe the IDS plane that eliminates the need for large amount of memory to a great extent. Narrow Path and Spread, which are two main features used in the inference engine of ALM, are then extracted from IDS planes with minimum amount of memory usage and power consumption. Our proposed algorithm is fully compatible with memristor-crossbar implementation that leads to a significant decrease in the number of required memristors (from O(n^2) to O(3n)).

The randomness in diffusive propagation is the main cause of inter-symbol interfe-rence (ISI) and the limiting factor of high data rate MCvD applications. In this paper, an apertured plane is considered between the transmitter and the receiver of an MCvD link. Either after being artificially placed or occurring naturally, surfaces or volumes that resemble an apertured plane only allow a fraction of the molecules to pass. Contrary to intuition, it is observed that such topology may improve communication performance, given the molecules that can pass through the aperture are the ones that take more directed paths towards the receiver. Furthermore, through both computer simulations and a theoretical signal evaluation metric named signal-to-interference and noise amplitude ratio (SINAR), it is found that the size of the aperture imposes a trade-off between the received signal power and the ISI combating capability of an MCvD system, hinting to an optimal aperture size that minimizes the bit error rate (BER). It is observed that the trend of BER is accurately mirrored by SINAR, suggesting the proposed metric\u2019s applicability to optimization tasks in MCvD systems, including finding the optimal aperture size of an apertured plane. In addition, computer simulations and SINAR show that said optimal aperture size is affected by the location of the aperture and the bit rate. Lastly, the paper analyzes the effects of radial and angular offsets in the placement of the apertured plane, and finds that a reduction in BER is still in effect up to certain offset values. Overall, our results imply that apertured plane-like surfaces may actually help communication efficiency, even though they reduce the received signal power.", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on NanoBioscience", "authors": ["Mustafa Can Gursoy", "H.

A particularly exciting vision is using them for implementing Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs), a class of deep neural networks with a highly reduced memory footprint. The challenge of resistive memory, however, is that they are prone to device variation, which can lead to bit errors. In this work we show that BNNs can tolerate these bit errors to an outstanding level, through simulations of networks on the MNIST and CIFAR10 tasks. If a standard BNN is used, up to 10\u22124 bit error rate can be tolerated with little impact on recognition performance on both MNIST and CIFAR10. We then show that by adapting the training procedure to the fact that the BNN will be operated on error-prone hardware, this tolerance can be extended to a bit error rate of 4 \u00d7 10\u22122.

Most countermeasures are tailored for CMOS integration and tend to incur excessive overheads, resulting from additional circuitry or device-level modifications.

Although initially tailored for error-tolerant applications, imprecise computing has gained traction as a general-purpose design technique. Emerging devices are currently being explored to implement ultralow-power circuits for inexact computing applications. In this paper, we quantify the security threats of imprecise computing using emerging devices. More specifically, we leverage the innate polymorphism and tunable stochastic behavior of spin-orbit torque (SOT) devices, particularly, the giant spin-Hall effect (GSHE) switch. We enable IP protection (by means of logic locking and camouflaging) simultaneously for deterministic and probabilistic computing, directly at the GSHE device level. We conduct a comprehensive security analysis using state-of-the-art Boolean satisfiability (SAT) attacks; this paper demonstrates the superior resilience of our GSHE primitive when tailored for deterministic computing. We also demonstrate how probabilistic computing can thwart most, if not all, existing SAT attacks. Based on this finding, we propose an attack scheme called probabilistic SAT (PSAT) which can bypass the defense offered by logic locking and camouflaging for imprecise computing schemes. Further, we illustrate how careful application of our GSHE primitive can remain secure even on the application of the PSAT attack.

Numerous special-purpose architectures have been proposed to accelerate training: both digital and hybrid digital-analog using resistive RAM (ReRAM) crossbars. ReRAM-based accelerators have demonstrated the effectiveness of ReRAM crossbars at performing matrix-vector multiplication operations that are prevalent in training. However, they still suffer from inefficiency due to the use of serial reads and writes for performing the weight gradient and update step. A few works have demonstrated the possibility of performing outer products in crossbars, which can be used to realize the weight gradient and update step without the use of serial reads and writes. However, these works have been limited to low precision operations which are not sufficient for typical training workloads. Moreover, they have been confined to a limited set of training algorithms for fully-connected layers only. To address these limitations, we propose a bit-slicing technique for enhancing the precision of ReRAM-based outer products, which is substantially different from bit-slicing for matrix-vector multiplication only. We incorporate this technique into a crossbar architecture with three variants catered to different training algorithms. To evaluate our design on different types of layers in neural networks (fully-connected, convolutional, etc.) and training algorithms, we develop PANTHER, an ISA-programmable training accelerator with compiler support. Our design can also be integrated into other accelerators in the literature to enhance their efficiency.

New concepts from game theory are applied to spectrum access analysis in order to extract rules of behaviour for an emerging environment. In order to assess OSA scenarios of CRs, two oligopoly game models are reformulated in terms of resource access: Cournot and Stackelberg games. Five CR scenes are analysed: simultaneous access of unlicensed users (commons regime) with symmetric and asymmetric costs, with and without bandwidth constraints and sequential access (licensed against unlicensed). Several equilibrium concepts are studied as game solutions: Nash, Pareto and the joint NashPareto equilibrium. The latter captures a game situation where players are non-homogeneous users, exhibiting different types of rationality, Nash and Pareto. This enables a more realistic modelling of interactions on a CR scene. An evolutionary game equilibrium detection method is used. The Nash equilibrium indicates the maximum number of channels a CR may access without decreasing its payoff. The Pareto equilibrium describes a larger range of payoffs, capturing unbalanced as well as equitable solutions.

The proposed calculation model is applied to multi-layer feedforward networks, in which weighted summations with positive and negative weights are separately performed in each layer and summation results are then fed into the next layers without their subtraction operation. We also propose very large-scale integrated (VLSI) circuits to implement the proposed model. Unlike the conventional analog voltage or current mode circuits, the time-domain analog circuits use transient operation in charging/discharging processes to capacitors. Since the circuits can be designed without operational amplifiers, they can operate with extremely low power consumption. However, they have to use very high resistance devices on the order of G$\\rm \\Omega$. We designed a proof-of-concept (PoC) CMOS VLSI chip to verify weighted-sum operation with the same weights and evaluated it by post-layout circuit simulation using 250-nm fabrication technology. High resistance operation was realized by using the subthreshold operation region of MOS transistors. Simulation results showed that energy efficiency for the weighted-sum calculation was 290~TOPS/W, more than one order of magnitude higher than that in state-of-the-art digital AI processors, even though the minimum width of interconnection used in the PoC chip was several times larger than that in such digital processors.

To this end, I present a more mathematically concrete challenge to hypercomputability, and will show that one is immediately led into physical impossibilities, thereby demonstrating the infeasibility of hypercomputers more generally. This gives impetus to propose and justify a more plausible starting point for an extension to the classical paradigm that is physically possible, at least in principle. Instead of attempting to rely on infinities such as idealized limits of infinite time or numerical precision, or some other physically unattainable source, one should focus on extending the classical paradigm to better encapsulate modern computational problems that are not well-expressed/modeled by the closed-system paradigm of the Turing machine.

Existing statistical element selection (SES) design method can improve transistor matching property, but it falls short of being a general calibration method due to its limited calibration range. In this dissertation, we propose a high resolution digital calibration method, called extended statistical element selection (ESES). As compared to the SES method, the ESES method not only provides wider calibration range, but also it results in higher calibration yield with same calibration resolution target. Two types of ESES based calibration application in analog/RF circuits are also proposed. One is current source calibration and the other is phase/delay calibration. To verify this proposed digital calibration method in circuit implementation, we designed, fabricated and tested a wideband harmonic rejection receiver design. The receiver utilizes ESES-based gain and phase error calibration for improving harmonic rejection ratios. With the high calibration resolution provided by the ESES method, after calibration, we achieved best-in-class harmonic rejection ratios.

In particular, we use seven IBM Q devices, the Aspen-9 Rigetti device, the IonQ device, and three D-Wave quantum annealers.For each of the fair sampling problems, we measure the ground state probability, the relative fairness of the frequency of each ground state solution with respect to the other ground state solutions, and the aggregate error as given by each hardware provider.

The Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model is one of the most successful mathematical models for bio-realistic simulations of the brain. However, the simulation of HH neurons involves complex computation, which makes the implementation of large-scale brain networks difficult. In this paper, we propose a hardware architecture that efficiently computes a large-scale network of HH neurons. This architecture is based on the neuron machine hardware architecture, which has the limitation of speed as it has only one computation node. The proposed architecture is essentially a non-Von Neumann synchronous system with multiple computation nodes, called hardware neurons, to achieve linear speedup. In this paper, the design of a digital circuit that computes large-scale networks of HH neurons is presented as an example to provide a detailed description of the proposed architecture. This design supports axonal conduction delay of spikes and short- and long-term plasticity synapses, along with floating-point precision HH neurons. The design is implemented on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) chip and computes a network of one million HH neurons in near real time. The implemented system can compute a network with up to 12 million HH neurons and 600 million synapses.

The latency of AQFP circuits is relatively long compared to that of other superconductor logic families and thus such circuits require low-latency clocking schemes.

However, it is unclear whether more complex AQFP circuits can adopt delay-line clocking. In the present study, we demonstrate AQFP logic gates (AND and XOR gates) that use delay-line clocking as a step towards implementing large-scale AQFP circuits with delay-line clocking. AND and XOR gates with a latency of approximately 20 ps per gate are shown to operate at up to 5 and 4 GHz, respectively, in experiments.

We develop a mathematical framework for modeling the time-variant stochastic channels of diffusive mobile MC systems. In particular, we consider a diffusive mobile MC system consisting of a pair of transmitter and receiver nano-machines suspended in a fluid medium with a uniform bulk flow, where we assume that either the transmitter or the receiver or both are mobile, and we model the mobility by Brownian motion. The transmitter and receiver nano-machines exchange information via diffusive signaling molecules. Due to the random movements of the transmitter and receiver nano-machines, the statistics of the channel impulse response (CIR) change over time. We derive closed-form expressions for the mean, the autocorrelation function (ACF), the cumulative distribution function (CDF), and the probability density function (PDF) of the time-variant CIR. Exploiting the ACF, we define the coherence time of the time-variant MC channel as a metric for characterization of the variations of the CIR. The derived CDF is employed for calculation of the outage probability of the system. We also show that under certain conditions, the PDF of the CIR can be accurately approximated by a Log-normal distribution. Based on this approximation, we derive a simple model for outdated channel state information (CSI). Moreover, we derive an analytical expression for the evaluation of the expected error probability of a simple detector for the considered MC system. In order to investigate the impact of CIR decorrelation over time, we compare the performances of a detector with perfect CSI knowledge and a detector with outdated CSI knowledge.

We show that the distance to criticality can be easily adapted by changing the input strength, and then demonstrate a clear relation between criticality, task-performance and information-theoretic fingerprint. Whereas the information-theoretic measures all show that network capacity is maximal at criticality, only the complex tasks profit from criticality, whereas simple tasks suffer.

Engineering such molecular computing systems is a major challenge for synthetic biology and related fields. The chemical reaction network (CRN) model idealizes chemical interactions, allowing rigorous reasoning about the computational power of chemical kinetics. Here we focus on function computation with CRNs, where we think of the initial concentrations of some species as the input and the equilibrium concentration of another species as the output.

Unfortunately, if two requests go to the same bank, they have to be served one after another, leading to lower system performance. We observe that a modern PCM bank is implemented as a collection of partitions that operate mostly independently while sharing a few global peripheral structures, which include the sense amplifiers (to read) and the write drivers (to write). Based on this observation, we propose PALP, a new mechanism that enables partition-level parallelism within each PCM bank, and exploits such parallelism by using the memory controller\u2019s access scheduling decisions. PALP consists of three new contributions. First, we introduce new PCM commands to enable parallelism in a bank\u2019s partitions in order to resolve the read-write bank conflicts, with no changes needed to PCM logic or its interface. Second, we propose simple circuit modifications that introduce a new operating mode for the write drivers, in addition to their default mode of serving write requests. When configured in this new mode, the write drivers can resolve the read-read bank conflicts, working jointly with the sense amplifiers. Finally, we propose a new access scheduling mechanism in PCM that improves performance by prioritizing those requests that exploit partition-level parallelism over other requests, including the long outstanding ones. While doing so, the memory controller also guarantees starvation-freedom and the PCM\u2019s running-average-power-limit (RAPL).

Here, we propose to replicate the kernel matrix of a convolution layer on distinct analog arrays, and randomly divide parts of the compute among them, so that multiple kernel matrices are trained in parallel. With this modification, analog arrays execute ConvNets with an acceleration factor that is proportional to the number of kernel matrices used per layer (here tested 16-128). Despite having more free parameters, we show analytically and in numerical experiments that this convolution architecture is self-regularizing and implicitly learns similar filters across arrays.

Consequently, it has been successfully utilized in the past to solve a variety of path problems in graphs and combinatorial problems.

The organism forages for food by growing these tubes towards detected foodstuff, this foraging behaviour is governed by simple rules of photoavoidance and chemotaxis. The electrical activity of the tubes oscillates, creating a peristaltic like action within the tubes, forcing cytoplasm along the lumen; the frequency of this oscillation controls the speed and direction of growth. External stimuli such as light and food cause changes in the oscillation frequency. We demonstrate that using these stimuli as logical inputs we can approximate logic gates using these tubes and derive combinational logic circuits by cascading the gates, with software analysis providing the output of each gate and determining the input of the following gate. Basic gates OR, AND and NOT were correct 90%, 77.8% and 91.7% of the time respectively. Derived logic circuits XOR, half adder and full adder were 70.8%, 65% and 58.8% accurate respectively. Accuracy of the combinational logic decreases as the number of gates is increased, however they are at least as accurate as previous logic approximations using spatial growth of P. polycephalum and up to 30 times as fast at computing the logical output.

Generally OxRAM cells consist of a transition metal oxide (typically HfO2, Ta2O5, TiO2) sandwiched between two metal electrodes (typically TiN, TaN, W but also Pt, Ir). This thesis describes the experimental investigation performed on OxRAM memories during a 6-months internship project at imec research institute (Leuven, Belgium). From previous studies, HfO-based OxRAM memories showed good endurance properties (with more than 10e9 write cycles), low operating current (as low as 10 uA), and very fast switching (programming pulses of 100 ns). However, it has been observed that, under low programming current condition, data stability becomes challenging. Therefore, this programming state stability needed further investigation. This thesis addresses the problem of state stability, first, by presenting the equipment and algorithms used to study OxRAM state loss over short time intervals. Secondly, various experiments and tests are performed searching for a key parameter in order to control memory retention. Finally, this work demonstrates that resistance evolution over time is affected by both a determinist drift (logarithmically dependent on time) and a random stochastic fluctuation component. It also demonstrates that this behavior is intrinsic in the nature of the device itself and does not depend on processing issues or variation in the programming conditions.

Fundamental to these applications is the weighted addition operation which is most often implemented by a multiplexer (mux) tree. Mux-based adders have very low area but typically require long bit-streams to reach practical accuracy thresholds when the number of summands is large. In this work, we first identify the main contributors to mux adder error. We then demonstrate with analysis and experiment that two new techniques, precise sampling and full correlation, can target and mitigate these error sources. Implementing these techniques in hardware leads to the design of CeMux (Correlation-enhanced Multiplexer), a stochastic mux adder that is significantly more accurate and uses much less area than traditional weighted adders. We compare CeMux to other SC and hybrid designs for an electrocardiogram filtering case study that employs a large digital filter. One major result is that CeMux is shown to be accurate even for large input sizes. CeMux's higher accuracy leads to a latency reduction of 4x to 16x over other designs. Further, CeMux uses about 35% less area than existing designs, and we demonstrate that a small amount of accuracy can be traded for a further 50% reduction in area.

Some methods take their inspiration from natural systems, extracting the salient features of such systems for use in classical computer algorithms. In this paper we demonstrate a simple unconventional computation method to approximate the Euclidean TSP using a virtual material approach. The morphological adaptation behaviour of the material emerges from the low-level interactions of a population of particles moving within a diffusive lattice. A \u2018blob\u2019 of this material is placed over a set of data points projected into the lattice, representing TSP city locations, and the blob is reduced in size over time. As the blob shrinks it morphologically adapts to the configuration of the cities. The shrinkage process automatically stops when the blob no longer completely covers all cities. By manually tracing the perimeter of the blob a path between cities is elicited corresponding to a TSP tour. Over 10 runs on 20 randomly generated datasets consisting of 20 cities this simple and unguided method found tours with a mean average tour length of 6.41\u00a0% longer than the minimum tours computed by a TSP solver (mean best performance was 4.27\u00a0% longer and mean worst performance was 9.22\u00a0% longer). We examine the insertion mechanism by which the blob constructs a tour, note some properties and limitations of its performance, and discuss the relationship between the blob TSP and proximity graphs which group points on the plane. The method is notable for its simplicity, novelty and the spatially represented mechanical mode of its operation. We discuss similarities between this method and previously suggested models of human performance on the TSP and suggest possibilities for further improvement.", "venue": "Natural Computing", "authors": ["Jeff  Jones", "Andrew  Adamatzky"], "year": 2013, "n_citations": 73}

Resistive crossbars offer a highly-parallel and efficient matrix-vector-multiplication (MVM) operation. MVM being the most dominant operation in DNNs makes crossbars ideally suited. However, various sources of device and circuit non-idealities lead to errors in the MVM output, thereby reducing DNN accuracy. Towards that end, we propose crossbar re-mapping strategies to mitigate line-resistance induced accuracy degradation in DNNs, without having to re-train the learned weights, unlike most prior works. Line-resistances degrade the voltage levels along the crossbar columns, thereby inducing more errors at the columns away from the drivers. We rank the DNN weights and kernels based on a sensitivity analysis, and re-arrange the columns such that the most sensitive kernels are mapped closer to the drivers, thereby minimizing the impact of errors on the overall accuracy. We propose two algorithms $-$ static remapping strategy (SRS) and dynamic remapping strategy (DRS), to optimize the crossbar re-arrangement of a pre-trained DNN. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach on a standard VGG16 network trained using CIFAR10 dataset. Our results show that SRS and DRS limit the accuracy degradation to 2.9\\% and 2.1\\%, respectively, compared to a 5.6\\% drop from an as it is mapping of weights and kernels to crossbars.

Here, we provide an algorithm for deciding whether one stabilizer (target) state can be obtained from another stabilizer (source) state by single-qubit Clifford operations (LC), single-qubit Pauli measurements (LPM) and classical communication (CC) between sites holding the individual qubits. What is more, we provide a recipe to obtain the sequence of LC+LPM+CC operations which prepare the desired target state from the source state, and show how these operations can be applied in parallel to reach the target state in constant time. Our algorithm has applications in quantum networks, quantum computing, and can also serve as a design tool\u2014for example, to find transformations between quantum error correcting codes. We provide a software implementation of our algorithm that makes this tool easier to apply. A key insight leading to our algorithm is to show that the problem is equivalent to one in graph theory, which is to decide whether some graph G\u2032 is a vertex-minor of another graph G. The vertex-minor problem is, in general, -Complete, but can be solved efficiently on graphs which are not too complex. A measure of the complexity of a graph is the rank-width which equals the Schmidt-rank width of a subclass of stabilizer states called graph states, and thus intuitively is a measure of entanglement. Here, we show that the vertex-minor problem can be solved in time O(|G|3), where |G| is the size of the graph G, whenever the rank-width of G and the size of G\u2032 are bounded. Our algorithm is based on techniques by Courcelle for solving fixed parameter tractable problems, where here the relevant fixed parameter is the rank width.

Crucially, this encodes the dataflow directly in the IR, allowing for a host of optimizations that leverage dataflow analysis. We discuss how to map existing quantum programming languages to the input dialect and how to lower the resulting IR to the optimization dialect. We present a prototype implementation based on MLIR that includes several quantum-specific optimization passes.

In this work, we set up reservoirs where the edges (or connections) between all the network nodes are either +1 or 0 and proceed to alter the network structure by flipping some of these edges from +1 to -1. We use this simple network because it turns out to be easy to characterize; we may use the fraction of edges flipped as a measure of how much we have altered the network. In some cases, the network can be rearranged in a finite number of ways without changing its structure; these rearrangements are symmetries of the network, and the number of symmetries is also useful for characterizing the network.

Increasingly, data-related issues are equally as important as the algorithmic methods used to process and learn from the data. Here we introduce an open-source graphics processing unit-accelerated neural network (NN) framework for learning reactive potential energy surfaces (PESs). To obtain training data for this NN framework, we investigate the use of real-time interactive ab initio molecular dynamics in virtual reality (iMD-VR) as a new data curation strategy that enables human users to rapidly sample geometries along reaction pathways. Focusing on hydrogen abstraction reactions of CN radical with isopentane, we compare the performance of NNs trained using iMD-VR data versus NNs trained using a more traditional method, namely, molecular dynamics (MD) constrained to sample a predefined grid of points along the hydrogen abstraction reaction coordinate. Both the NN trained using iMD-VR data and the NN trained using the constrained MD data reproduce important qualitative features of the reactive PESs, such as a low and early barrier to abstraction. Quantitative analysis shows that NN learning is sensitive to the data set used for training. Our results show that user-sampled structures obtained with the quantum chemical iMD-VR machinery enable excellent sampling in the vicinity of the minimum energy path (MEP). As a result, the NN trained on the iMD-VR data does very well predicting energies that are close to the MEP but less well predicting energies for \"off-path\" structures. The NN trained on the constrained MD data does better predicting high-energy off-path structures, given that it included a number of such structures in its training set.", "venue": "The journal of physical chemistry.

The arithmetic circuits presented can be used as basic building blocks for higher level algorithms such as quantum phase estimation, quantum simulation, quantum optimization etc., but they can also be used in the implementation of a quantum fractional Fourier transform as it is shown in a companion work presented separately.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Archimedes  Pavlidis", "Emmanuel  Floratos"], "year": 2017, "n_citations": 10}

We propose modifications to STT-MRAM peripheral circuits that leverage this principle to perform logic, arithmetic, and complex vector operations. We address the challenge of reliable in-memory computing under process variations by extending error-correction code schemes to detect and correct errors that occur during CiM operations.

Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) storage is identified as such a promising candidate, especially for archival storage systems. However, the encoding density (i.e., how many binary bits can be encoded into one nucleotide) and error handling are two major factors intertwined in DNA storage. Considering encoding density, theoretically, one nucleotide (i.e., A, T, G, or C) can encode two binary bits (upper bound). However, due to biochemical constraints and other necessary information associated with payload, currently the encoding densities of various DNA storage systems are much less than this upper bound. Additionally, all existing studies of DNA encoding schemes are based on static analysis and really lack the awareness of dynamically changed digital patterns. Therefore, the gap between the static encoding and dynamic binary patterns prevents achieving a higher encoding density for DNA storage systems. In this paper, we propose a new Digital Pattern-Aware DNA storage system, called DP-DNA, which can efficiently store digital data in the DNA storage with high encoding density. DP-DNA maintains a set of encoding codes and uses a digital pattern-aware code (DPAC) to analyze the patterns of a binary sequence for a DNA strand and selects an appropriate code for encoding the binary sequence to achieve a high encoding density. An additional encoding field is added to the DNA encoding format, which can distinguish the encoding scheme used for those DNA strands, and thus we can decode DNA data back to its original digital data. Moreover, to further improve the encoding density, a variable-length scheme is proposed to increase the feasibility of the code scheme with a high encoding density. Finally, the experimental results indicate that the proposed DP-DNA achieves up to 103.5% higher encoding densities than prior work.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Bingzhe  Li", "Li  Ou", "David  Du"], "year": 2021, "n_citations": 0}

Using bacteria as the basis for biologically feasible computational models may allow models to better harness the tremendous ability of biological organisms to make decisions and process information.

The debilitating effects of spinal cord injuries (SCI) impact a significant number of people throughout the world, and to date, there is no satisfactory method to treat them. In this paper, we review the major treatment techniques for SCI that include promising solutions based on information and communication technology (ICT) and identify the key characteristics of such systems. We then introduce two novel ICT-based treatment approaches for SCI. The first proposal is based on neural interface systems (NIS) with enhanced feedback, where the external machines are interfaced with the brain and the spinal cord such that the brain signals are directly routed to the limbs for movement. The second proposal relates to the design of self-organizing artificial neurons (ANs) that can be used to replace the injured or dead biological neurons. Apart from SCI treatment, the proposed methods may also be utilized as enabling technologies for neural interface applications by acting as bio-cyber interfaces between the nervous system and machines.

In this paper, molecular space shift keying (MSSK) is proposed as a novel modulation for molecular MIMO systems, and it is found that this method combats ISI and ILI considerably better than the existing MIMO approaches. For nanomachines that have access to two different molecules, the direct extension of MSSK, quadrature MSSK (QMSSK) is also proposed. QMSSK is found to combat ISI considerably well while not performing well against ILI-caused errors.

However, some other devices like resistor or capacitor are still necessary in recent works of fully memristive learning framework. Theoretically, if one neuron is built by memristors only, the technique process will be simpler and learning framework will be more like biological brain. In this paper, a fully memristive spiking-neuron learning framework is introduced, in which a neuron structure is just built of one drift and one diffusion memristive models and spikes are used as transmission signals. The learning framework and spiking coding mode are simple and direct without any complicated calculation on hardware. To verify its merits, a feedforward neural network for pattern recognition and a cellular neural network for edge detection are designed. Experimental results show that compared to other memristive neural networks, processing speed of the proposed framework is very high, and the hardware resource is saved in pattern recognition.

An artificial neuron sums N weighted inputs and passes the result through a non-linear transfer function. Large-scale ANNs impose very high computing requirements for training and classification, leading to great interest in the use of post-CMOS devices to realize them in an energy efficient manner. In this paper, we propose a spin-transfer-torque (STT) device based on domain wall motion (DWM) magnetic strip that can efficiently implement a soft-limiting non-linear neuron (SNN) operating at ultra-low supply voltage and current. In contrast to previous spin-based neurons that can only realize hard-limiting transfer functions, the proposed STT-SNN displays a continuous resistance change with varying input current, and can therefore be employed to implement a soft-limiting neuron transfer function. Soft-limiting neurons are greatly preferred to hard-limiting ones due to their much improved modeling capacity, which leads to higher network accuracy and lower network complexity. We also present an ANN hardware design employing the proposed STT-SNNs and memristor crossbar arrays (MCA) as synapses. The ultra-low voltage operation of the magneto metallic STT-SNN enables the programmable MCA-synapses, computing analog-domain weighted summation of input voltages, to also operate at ultra-low voltage.

In this paper we present a closed-loop motor controller implemented on a mixed-signal analog/digital neuromorphic processor which emulates a spiking neural network that continuously calculates an error signal from the desired target and the feedback signals. The system uses population coding and recurrent Winner-Take-All networks to encode the signals robustly.

Here, we use a phenomenological model to demonstrate that such reservoirs can be optimised for classification tasks by tuning hyperparameters that control the scaling and input-rate of data into the system using rotating magnetic fields. We use taskindependent metrics to assess the rings\u2019 computational capabilities at each set of these hyperparameters and show how these metrics correlate directly to performance in spoken and written digit recognition tasks. We then show that these metrics, and performance in tasks, can be further improved by expanding the reservoir\u2019s output to include multiple, concurrent measures of the ring arrays\u2019 magnetic states. Neuromorphic devices use inherent material properties to perform brain-like computational operations in materio. This allows for improvements in efficiency over standard artificial neural networks as neural architectures are directly emulated in hardware, rather than simulated using conventional computers [1]. Reservoir computing (RC) is a machine learning paradigm that is well-suited to in materio implementations. In RC, a fixed dynamical system (the reservoir) transforms input signals into higher dimensional states. In the archetypal Echo State Networks (ESNs) [2], the reservoir takes the form of a recurrent neural network (RNN) initialised with a sparse, random connectivity matrix. A linear readout layer provides output from the weighted sum of activity across nodes within the reservoir [3]. ESNs address the well-known difficulties of training RNNs, and recent models have improved their applicability to classification tasks and their robustness against catastrophic forgetting [4]. While ESNs are typically simulated on conventional computers, recent studies have shown that computational ability is preserved if the RNNs are replaced by physical systems [5]\u2013 [9] with the correct properties: nonlinearity between input and output, and fading memory. In these approaches, excitations of the systems are achieved through inputs such as light [6], electric current/voltage [10], or magnetic field [11], and output is taken by measuring the systems\u2019 evolving states. Different devices provide different reservoir transformations, with different dynamical regimes of a given device offering further flexibility. However, assessing the computational power of these is often difficult. To overcome this, task-independent metrics of Kernel Rank (KR), Generalisation Rank (GR) [12], and Linear Memory Capacity (MC) [13] can be employed. These allow empirical measurement of the reservoir\u2019s ability to separate, generalise, and remember input respectively. Recently, we proposed interconnected magnetic nano-ring arrays as candidate platforms for RC [14]. Rotating fields drive domain walls (DWs) around the rings\u2019 circumferences. Stochastic interactions between pinned and propagating DWs at the rings\u2019 junctions result in both DW loss and gain mechanisms, and emergent evolution of the rings\u2019 collective magnetic states. In our previous work we show that these dynamics are both non-linear and exhibit fading memory, thus meeting the primary criteria for RC [14]. Furthermore, the transformations provided by the rings\u2019 response can be varied by controlling how input data scales the applied field, and it\u2019s input rate. This offers the possibility of tuning their responses for different computational tasks. In this paper, we use task-independent metrics to assess the computational capabilities of a modelled magnetic nanoring array. We show how controlling the scaling and input-rate of data allows these metrics to be tuned, and how their variation correlates to performance in a pair of benchmark classification tasks (spoken and handwritten digit recognition). We then demonstrate how expanding the reservoir\u2019s output to include multiple, concurrent measures of the array\u2019s magnetic state further improves upon these reservoir metrics and performance in classification tasks [4].

(c) Equilibrium magnetization of the array as a function of applied field as measured by PNR (red symbols) [14] and fitted by the model (black line). (d) Magnetization images generated by the model and by XPEEM after 10 rotations of 50 Oe applied field. The modelled image includes a blurred region to aid comparisons. The system modelled here consisted of a 25 x 25 square array (Figure 1(a)) of 4 \u03bcm diameter, 400 nm line width Ni80Fe20 rings, with thickness t = 20 nm. This system was experimentally characterised in [14], where we also created and validated a phenomenological model of its behavior. Here, we use this model, RingSim, to simulate the response of a ring system to streams of data encoded using the amplitude of a rotating magnetic field, with the simulated magnetic states of the array acting as output. In RingSim, rings exist in \u2018onion\u2019 states containing pairs of DWs (Figure 1(b.i)), or \u2018vortex\u2019 states, containing no domain walls (Figure 1(b.iv)). DWs are instanced into RingSim as agents which attempt to follow the rotating field to minimise Zeeman energy [15]. Differential movement of DWs inside a ring leads to formation of \u20183/4\u2019 state DWs (Figure 1(b.ii)), or collapse into vortex state upon DW collision (Figure 1(b.iii/iv)). Junctions between rings create anti-notch-like energy barriers against DW propagation [16], [17]. DW depinning is modelled as thermal activation over a single energy barrier following the Arrhenius-N\u00e9el law [18]. The size of these energy barriers is modulated by the circumferential component of applied field in accordance with Sharrock\u2019s equation [19]. The stochastic nature of DW pinning is modelled by comparing random floating points to calculated reversal probabilities. If the generated number exceeds the calculated probability of the DW remaining pinned, then the DW is considered free to advance to either the next energy barrier or the appropriate Zeeman energy minima. The effects of DW-DW interactions were incorporated phenomenologically. Further details may be found in [14]. RingSim was defined by 4 free parameters: H0 sw , H\u03c3 , E0, \u03b1. These parameters represent the DWs\u2019 mean zero-temperature depinning field, the standard distribution of DW pinning fields, the zero-field energy barrier, and the exponent of the Sharrock equation. In this study, these parameters were determined by fitting RingSim\u2019s output to the results of polarised neutron reflectivity (PNR) measurements that where the array\u2019s magnetization was measured as a function of rotating field amplitude. Here, measurements were taken following 50 rotations at each applied field amplitude, with saturation and relaxation of the array occurring before each measurement [14]. The data thus represented a dynamic equilibrium magnetization state of the array at each applied field amplitude. Figure 1(c) shows that RingSim fitted the data well, with agreement being particularly strong in the region where applied field equals 35 75 Oe, where the system exhibited an emergent response. Furthermore, images generated from RingSim in this regime of behavior showed good qualitative agreement with X-ray photo-electron emission microscopy images (X-PEEM), (Figure 1(d)), with both showing extended domains forming over similar length scales in the array. Further details of the validation of RingSim against experimental results can be found in [14]. Figure 2: (a) The ESN approach to RC where the reservoir takes the form of an RNN. (b) Our approach, where the ring array acts as a single dynamical node, into which time-multiplexed data is input using a rotating magnetic field. RC involves the transformation of discrete-time input signals, u(t), to reservoir states, x(t) (Figure 2(a)). The reservoir configuration employed here follows the paradigm of a single dynamical node, as introduced by Appeltant et al [5] (Figure 2(b)). Here, the network is constructed of \u2018virtual\u2019 nodes, created by observing a physical property of a dynamic system as it responds to time-multiplexed input. This approach has been used in a wide range of physical reservoirs due to its ease of implementation [2], [7], [8], [11]\u2013 [13], [25]. An input matrix, u\u03c4,\u03b8, is generated from raw input signal s\u03c4,d multiplied with mask matrix Md,\u03b8 , where d = number of input dimensions, \u03c4 is the number of time-steps of the signal, and \u03b8 is the number of virtual nodes. Matrix u\u03c4,\u03b8 was then flattened by concatenating row by row, producing a 1D input signal of length \u03c4 \u2217 \u03b8. For d > 1, Md,\u03b8 was filled with random binary numbers to provide different mixtures of the input dimensions across the virtual nodes. For single-dimensional inputs, an analogue mask was used instead to excite different responses in the reservoir over time. For an input datum i from ui, the applied field amplitude was given by: Happlied i = Hcentre + Hrange ui {1} Where Hcentre and Hrange represented the offset and scaling of the rotating field sequence. Each input was applied for a given number of quarter-rotations of field, Nq.rot, matching the fourfold rotational symmetry of the array. Three state variables were logged at the end of each input: the total domain wall population (DWP), and the array\u2019s net magnetization components in the x and y directions, Mx and My creating a reservoir state vector of length 3\u03b8. The output vector xi is thus three times the length of ui. Experimentally, the values of Mx and My could be measured using giant magneto resistive (GMR) multilayers with appropriately aligned pinned layers [25], while a proxy for DWP could be obtained through anisotrop", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Ian T Vidamour", "Matthew O A Ellis", "David  Griffin", "Guru  Venkat", "Charles  Swindells", "Richard W S Dawidek", "Thomas J Broomhall", "Nina-Juliane  Steinke", "Joshaniel F K Cooper", "Francisco  Maccherozzi", "Sarnjeet S Dhesi", "Susan  Stepney", "Eleni  Vasilaki", "Dan A Allwood", "Thomas J Hayward"], "year": 2021, "n_citations": 0}

The space symbol is transmitted by embedding the information into the index of a single activated transmitter nanomachine. The concentration symbol is drawn according to the conventional concentration shift keying (CSK) constellation. Benefiting from a single active transmitter during each symbol period, SM-MC can avoid the inter-link interference problem existing in the current multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) based MC schemes, which hence enables low-complexity symbol detection and performance improvement. Correspondingly, we propose a low-complexity scheme, which first detects the space symbol by energy comparison, and then detects the concentration symbol by the maximum ratio combining assisted CSK demodulation. In this paper, we analyze the symbol error rate (SER) of the SM-MC and of its special case, namely the space shift keying-based MC (SSK-MC), where only space symbol is transmitted and no CSK modulation is invoked. Finally, the analytical results are validated by computer simulations.

Beyond a field of research, instances of the SAT problem, as it is known, require efficient solution methods in a variety of applications. It is the decision problem of determining whether a Boolean formula has a satisfying assignment, believed to require exponentially growing time for an algorithm to solve for the worst-case instances. Yet, the efficient solution of many classes of Boolean formulae eludes even the most successful algorithms, not only for the worst-case scenarios, but also for typical-case instances. Here, we introduce a memory-assisted physical system (a digital memcomputing machine) that, when its non-linear ordinary differential equations are integrated numerically, shows evidence for polynomially-bounded scalability while solving \u201chard\u201d planted-solution instances of SAT, known to require exponential time to solve in the typical case for both complete and incomplete algorithms. Furthermore, we analytically demonstrate that the physical system can efficiently solve the SAT problem in continuous time, without the need to introduce chaos or an exponentially growing energy. The efficiency of the simulations is related to the collective dynamical properties of the original physical system that persist in the numerical integration to robustly guide the solution search even in the presence of numerical errors.

However, since physical realizations of quantum computers are in their infancy, a significant amount of research in this domain still relies on simulations of quantum computations on conventional machines. This causes a significant complexity which current state-of-the-art simulators try to tackle with a rather straight forward array-based representation and by applying massive hardware power. There also exist solutions based on decision diagrams (i.e., graph-based approaches) that try to tackle the exponential complexity by exploiting redundancies in quantum states and operations. However, these existing approaches do not fully exploit redundancies that are actually present.

Split manufacturing (SM) and layout camouflaging (LC) are promising techniques to protect the intellectual property (IP) of ICs from malicious entities during and after manufacturing (i.e., from untrusted foundries and reverse-engineering by end-users). In this paper, we strive for \u201cthe best of both worlds,\u201d that is of SM and LC. To do so, we extend both techniques towards 3D integration, an up-and-coming design and manufacturing paradigm based on stacking and interconnecting of multiple chips/dies/tiers. Initially, we review prior art and their limitations. We also put forward a novel, practical threat model of IP piracy which is in line with the business models of present-day design houses. Next, we discuss how 3D integration is a naturally strong match to combine SM and LC. We propose a security-driven CAD and manufacturing flow for face-to-face (F2F) 3D ICs, along with obfuscation of interconnects. Based on this CAD flow, we conduct comprehensive experiments on DRC-clean layouts.

This is because the synaptic storage resources on a tile, viz., a crossbar, can accommodate only a fixed number of presynaptic connections per postsynaptic neuron. For complex SNN models that have many presynaptic connections per neuron, some connections may need to be pruned after training to fit onto the tile resources, leading to a loss in the model quality, e.g., accuracy. In this letter, we propose a novel unrolling technique that decomposes a neuron function with many presynaptic connections into a sequence of homogeneous neural units, where each neural unit is a function computation node, with two presynaptic connections. This spatial decomposition technique significantly improves crossbar utilization and retains all presynaptic connections, resulting in no loss of the model quality derived from connection pruning. We integrate the proposed technique within an existing SNN mapping framework and evaluate it using machine learning applications on the DYNAP-SE state-of-the-art neuromorphic hardware.

We need to begin intensive development work on this technology soon if we want to maintain advances in computing and the attendant economic growth NOTE: This paper is an extended author\u2019s preprint of the feature article titled \u201cThrowing Computing Into Reverse\u201d (print) or \u201cThe Future of Computing Depends on Making it Reversible\u201d (online), published by IEEE Spectrum in Aug.-Sep. 2017. This preprint is based on the original draft manuscript that the author submitted to Spectrum, prior to IEEE edits and feedback from external readers. Since the dawn of the transistor, technologists, and the world at large, have grown accustomed to a steady trend of exponentially-improving performance for information technologies at any given cost level. This performance growth has been enabled by the underlying trend, described by Moore\u2019s Law, of the exponentially-increasing number of electronic devices (such as transistors) that can be fabricated on an integrated circuit. According to the classic rules of semiconductor scaling, as transistors were made smaller, they became simultaneously cheaper, faster, and more energy-efficient, a massive win-win-win scenario, which resulted in concordantly massive investments in the ongoing push to advance semiconductor fabrication technology to ever-smaller length scales. Unfortunately, there is today a growing consensus within industry, academia, and government labs that semiconductor scaling has not very much life left; maybe 10 years or so, at best. Multiple issues that come into play as we dive deeper into the nanoscale mean that the classic scaling trends are losing steam. Already, the decreasing logic voltages required due to various short-channel effects resulted in the plateauing of clock speeds more than a decade ago, driving the shift towards today\u2019s multi-core architectures. But now, even multi-core architectures face the looming threat of increasing amounts of \u201cdark silicon,\u201d as heat dissipation constraints prevent us from being able to cram any more operations per second into each unit of chip area, due to the energy that is converted to heat in each operation. Fundamentally, achieving higher performance within a system of any given size, cost, and power budget requires that individual * This work was supported by the Laboratory Directed Research and Development program at Sandia National Laboratories and by the Advanced Simulation and Computing program under the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA).

Looking forward, as transistors become smaller, their per-area leakage current and standby power increases; meanwhile, as signal energies are decreased, thermal fluctuations become more significant, eventually preventing any further progress within the traditional computing paradigm. Heroic efforts are being made within the semiconductor industry to try to allay and forestall these problems, but the solutions are becoming ever more expensive to deploy, with new leading-edge chip fabrication plants (\u201cfabs\u201d) now costing on the order of $10 billion each. But, it\u2019s worth pointing out that no level of spending can ever defeat the laws of physics. Beyond some point that is, now, not very far away, a new conventionally-designed computer that simply has smaller transistors would no longer be any cheaper, faster, or more energy-efficient than its predecessors, and at that point, the progress of conventional semiconductor technology will stop, being no longer economically justifiable. The writing is on the wall. Obviously, however, we would prefer if the progress in the cost-efficiency of information technology were not to stop, since a large portion of our potential future economic progress would be empowered by the continuing advancement of this technology. So then the question arises, can we perhaps keep progress in computing going by transitioning over to some new technology base that is not \u201cconventional semiconductor technology?\u201d Unfortunately, some of the most crucial fundamental physical barriers that will prevent conventional complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology from advancing very much further will also still apply, in a more or less comparable way, to any alternative technology as well, as long as we insist on maintaining the present-day computing paradigm, namely irreversible computing. No other irreversible \u201cbeyond CMOS\u201d technology can ever be very much better than end-of-the-line CMOS\u2014at most, it will be better only by some relatively modest, limited factor. However, for several decades now, we have known that there exists a theoretically possible alternative computing paradigm, called reversible computing. Developing reversible computing (and then continuing to improve it) is in fact the only possible way, within the laws of physics, that we might be able to keep computer energy-efficiency and cost-efficiency for general applications increasing indefinitely, far into the future. So far, the concept of reversible computing has not received very much attention, which has perhaps made sense up until now, since it is indeed highly challenging to implement effectively, and the alternative of advancing conventional technology was much easier. Nevertheless, significant conceptual progress on reversible computing has been made over the decades by the small number of researchers pursuing it. Still, many difficult problems remain to be solved, and it is going to require a much larger effort, looking forwards, to address them. But, this effort will be highly worthwhile, because the potential upside that reversible computing offers is many orders of magnitude of information technology efficiency improvements, with associated economic advancements, compared to all possible irreversible computing technologies. With the end of conventional technology now in sight, it\u2019s now time that the world\u2019s best physics and engineering minds turn committed attention towards reversible computing, and begin an all-out effort to tackle its remaining engineering challenges, so as to bring this idea to practical fruition. The first person to describe the energy-efficiency implications of the conventional irreversible computing paradigm was Rolf Landauer of IBM, who wrote a paper in 1961 called \u201cIrreversibility and Heat Generation in the Computing Process.\u201d This paper has generated controversy in some circles, but Landauer\u2019s key insight in this paper really does just follow directly as an immediate logical consequence of our most thorough, battle-tested understanding of fundamental physics. All of our most fundamental laws of low-level physical dynamics are reversible, meaning that if you were to have complete knowledge of the state of any given closed system at some time, and of the values of all of the relevant physical constants, M.P. Frank Back to the Future: Extended preprint Sandia National Labs The Case for Reversible Computing for IEEE Spectrum Version 5.7 arXiv:1803.02789 [cs.ET] Page 3 of 19 3/7/2018 7:48 PM you could always, conceptually, run the laws of physics backwards, and determine the system\u2019s past state at any previous time exactly. (This is even true in quantum mechanics, if you knew the exact quantum state of the system.) As a consequence, it is impossible to have a situation wherein two different possible detailed states at some earlier time, could both evolve to become the exact same detailed state as each other at some later time, since this would mean that the earlier state couldn\u2019t be uniquely determined from the later one. In other words, at the lowest level in physics, information cannot be destroyed. It\u2019s important to realize how absolutely essential to our most basic understanding of physics this principle is. If it wasn\u2019t true, then the Second Law of Thermodynamics (which says that entropy cannot decrease) could not be true, since entropy is just unknown information. If physics was not reversible, then entropy could simply vanish, and the Second Law would not hold. How does the indestructibility of information relate to the energy efficiency of irreversible computing? The point is that, since physics is reversible, whenever we think that we are destroying some information in a computer, we actually are not. Putatively \u201cirreversible\u201d operations (such as erasing a bit of information, or destructively overwriting it with a newly-computed value) are, in some sense, really just a convenient fiction. What\u2019s actually happening, at the most fundamental level, is that the physical information that is embodied within the systems whose state we think we are \u201cerasing\u201d or \u201coverwriting\u201d (e.g., a circuit node charged to a particular voltage) is simply getting pushed out into the machine\u2019s thermal environment, where it effectively becomes entropy (in essence, randomized information), and is manifested as heat. To increase the entropy of a thermal environment at temperature T by an increment \u2206S requires adding an increment of heat \u2206Q = T\u2206S to that environment; that is simply the thermodynamic definition of temper", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Michael P.

Due to the massive number of devices served by the base stations (BS) equipped with large antenna arrays, massive-MIMO systems need to perform high-dimensional signal processing in a considerably short amount of time. The computational complexity of such data processing, while satisfying the energy and latency requirements, is beyond the capabilities of the conventional widely-used digital electronics-based computing, i.e., Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). In this paper, the speed and lossless propagation of light is exploited to introduce a photonic computing approach that addresses the high computational complexity required by massive-MIMO systems. The proposed computing approach is based on photonic implementation of multiply and accumulate (MAC) operation achieved by broadcast-and-weight (B&W) architecture. The B&W protocol is limited to real and positive values to perform MAC operations. In this work, preprocessing steps are developed to enable the proposed photonic computing architecture to accept any arbitrary values as the input. This is a requirement for wireless communication systems that typically deal with complex values.

It would be useful to know what happens in the quantum processor during the anneal process so that one could design better algorithms or suggest improvements to the hardware. However, existing quantum annealers are not able to directly extract such information from the processor. Hence, in this article we propose to use advanced features of D-Wave 2000Q to indirectly infer information about the dynamics of the state evolution during the anneal process. Specifically, D-Wave 2000Q allows the user to customize the anneal schedule, that is, the schedule with which the anneal fraction is changed from the start to the end of the anneal. Using this feature, we design a set of modified anneal schedules whose outputs can be used to generate information about the states of the system at user-defined time points during a standard anneal. With this process, called slicing, we obtain approximate distributions of lowest-energy anneal solutions as the anneal time evolves. We use our technique to obtain a variety of insights into the annealer, such as the state evolution during annealing, when individual bits in an evolving solution flip during the anneal process and when they stabilize, and we introduce a technique to estimate the freeze-out point of both the system as well as of individual qubits.", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems", "authors": ["Elijah  Pelofske", "Georg  Hahn", "Hristo  Djidjev"], "year": 2022, "n_citations": 0}

As a brief introduction, in a multiplication with two operands, one operand is programmed as input signal, and the other operand is saved into a so-called crossbar structure, which contains a group of memristors, and each memristor saves several valid bits, usually one or two bits only. The computation results,i.e. the multiplication of the two operands, are contained in the outputs of the crossbar structure together with noise. Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs) are then used to extract the valid bits, which are the most significant bits of outputs. These valid bits can be combined together with Digital-to-Analog Converters(DACs) to get the final results.

Inherent stochasticity in the fabrication process and nanometer scale of these substrates inevitably lead to design variations, defects, faults, and noise in the resulting devices. A key challenge is how to harness such devices to perform robust computation. We propose reservoir computing as a solution. In reservoir computing, computation takes place by translating the dynamics of an excited medium, called a reservoir, into a desired output. This approach eliminates the need for external control and redundancy, and the programming is done using a closed-form regression problem on the output, which also allows concurrent programming using a single device. Using a theoretical model, we show that both regular and irregular reservoirs are intrinsically robust to structural noise as they perform computation.", "venue": "UCNC", "authors": ["Alireza  Goudarzi", "Matthew R.

These network systems integrated with neurons and synapses provide computational efficiency by mimicking the human brain. It is desired to incorporate the biological neuronal dynamics, including complex spiking patterns which represent diverse brain activities within the neural networks. Earlier hardware realization of neurons was (1) area intensive because of large capacitors in the circuit design, (2) neuronal spiking patterns were demonstrated with clocked neurons at the device level. To achieve more realistic biological neuron spiking behavior, emerging memristive devices are considered promising alternatives. In this paper, we propose, PrMnO3(PMO) -RRAM device-based neuron. The voltage-controlled electrothermal timescales of the compact PMO RRAM device replace the electrical timescales of charging a large capacitor. The electrothermal timescale is used to implement an integration block with multiple voltage-controlled timescales coupled with a refractory block to generate biological neuronal dynamics. Here, first, a Verilog-A implementation of the thermal device model is demonstrated, which captures the current-temperature dynamics of the PMO device. Second, a driving circuitry is designed to mimic different spiking patterns of cortical neurons, including Intrinsic bursting (IB) and Chattering (CH). Third, a neuron circuit model is simulated, which includes the PMO RRAM device model and the driving circuitry to demonstrate the asynchronous neuron behavior. Finally, a hardware-software hybrid analysis is done in which the PMO RRAM device is experimentally characterized to mimic neuron spiking dynamics.

Time-of-flight is perhaps the most intuitive method for localization using wireless signals. If one can accurately measure the time-of-flight from a transmitter, one can compute the transmitter's distance simply by multiplying the time-of-flight by the speed of light. Today, GPS, the most widely used outdoor localization system, localizes a device using the time-of-flight of radio signals from satellites. However, applying the same concept to indoor localization has proven difficult. Systems for localization in indoor spaces are expected to deliver high accuracy (e.g., a meter or less) using consumer-oriented technologies (e.g., Wi-Fi on one's cellphone). Unfortunately, past work could not measure time-of-flight at such an accuracy on Wi-Fi devices. As a result, over the years, research on accurate indoor positioning has moved towards more complex alternatives such as employing large multi-antenna arrays to compute the angle-of-arrival of the signal. These new techniques have delivered highly accurate indoor localization systems. Despite these advances, time-of-flight based localization has some of the basic desirable features that state-of-the-art indoor localization systems lack. In particular, measuring time-of-flight does not require more than a single antenna on the receiver. In fact, by measuring time-of-flight of a signal to just two antennas, a receiver can intersect the corresponding distances to locate its source. Thus, a receiver can locate a wireless transmitter with no support from the surrounding infrastructure. This is quite unlike current indoor localization systems, which require multiple access points at known locations, to find the distance between a pair of mobile devices. Furthermore, each of these access points need to have many antennas -- far beyond what is supported in commercial Wi-Fi devices. In this demo, we will present Chronos, a system that combines a set of novel algorithms to measure the time-of-flight to sub-nanosecond accuracy on commercial Wi-Fi cards. In particular, we will measure distance/time-of-flight between two devices equipped with commercial Wi-Fi cards, without any support from the infrastructure or environment fingerprinting.", "venue": "SIGCOMM 2015", "authors": ["Deepak  Vasisht", "Swarun  Kumar", "Dina  Katabi"], "year": 2015, "n_citations": 12}

However, in order to enable full adoption of processing-using-DRAM, it is necessary to provide support for more complex operations. In this paper, we propose SIMDRAM, a flexible general-purpose processing-using-DRAM framework that (1) enables the efficient implementation of complex operations, and (2) provides a flexible mechanism tosupport the implementation of arbitrary user-defined operations. The SIMDRAM framework comprises three key steps. The first step builds an efficient MAJ/NOT representation of a given desired operation. The second step allocates DRAM rows that are reserved for computation to the operation\u2019s input and output operands, and generates the required sequence of DRAM commands to perform the MAJ/NOT implementation of the desired operation in DRAM. The third step uses the SIMDRAM control unit located inside the memory controller to manage the computation of the operation from start to end, by executing the DRAM commands generated in the second step of the framework. We design the hardware and ISA support for SIMDRAM framework to (1) address key system integration challenges, and (2) allow programmers to employ new SIMDRAM operations without hardware changes.

We are motivated by the recent development of dedicated optics-based hardware for rapid random projections which leverages the propagation of light in random media. A signal of interest $\\mathbf{\\xi} \\in \\mathbb{R}^N$ is mixed by a random scattering medium to compute the projection $\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{\\xi}$, with $\\mathbf{A} \\in \\mathbb{C}^{M \\times N}$ being a realization of a standard complex Gaussian iid random matrix. Such optics-based matrix multiplications can be much faster and energy-efficient than their CPU or GPU counterparts, yet two difficulties must be resolved: only the intensity ${|\\mathbf{y}|}^2$ can be recorded by the camera, and the transmission matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ is unknown. We show that even without knowing $\\mathbf{A}$, we can recover the unknown phase of $\\mathbf{y}$ for some equivalent transmission matrix with the same distribution as $\\mathbf{A}$. Our method is based on two observations: first, conjugating or changing the phase of any row of $\\mathbf{A}$ does not change its distribution; and second, since we control the input we can interfere $\\mathbf{\\xi}$ with arbitrary reference signals. We show how to leverage these observations to cast the measurement phase retrieval problem as a Euclidean distance geometry problem.

To realize firing of this nanomagnetic implementation of an artificial neuron, we propose to employ voltage control of magnetic anisotropy or voltage generated strain as an input (spike or sinusoidal) signal, which modulates the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). This results in continual expansion and shrinking (i.e. breathing) of a skyrmion core that mimics the subthreshold oscillation. Any subsequent input pulse having an interval close to the breathing period or a sinusoidal input close to the eigen frequency drives the magnetization dynamics of the fixed skyrmion in a resonant manner. The time varying electrical resistance of the MTJ layer due to this resonant oscillation of the skyrmion core is used to drive a Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) buffer circuit, which produces spike outputs.

The Manhattan-like topology chosen to realize the controller network in the testbed under development is irregular, with restricted local path selection options, operating in an asynchronous fashion. These characteristics render traditional fault-tolerant routing mechanisms inadequate. In this paper, we present work in progress towards the development of fault-tolerant routing mechanisms for the chosen architecture.

Thus, path loss and multi-path fading effects can be controlled and mitigated.

Recently, tuneable nanoelectronic devices were developed based on hopping electrons through a network of dopant atoms in silicon.

By adapting the control voltages applied to its electrodes, a single DNPU can solve a variety of linearly non-separable classification problems.

This paper presents a promising novel approach to neural information processing by introducing DNPUs as high-capacity neurons and moving from a single to a multi-neuron framework. By implementing and testing a small multi-DNPU classifier in hardware, we show that feed-forward DNPU networks improve the performance of a single DNPU from 77% to 94% test accuracy on a binary classification task with concentric classes on a plane. Furthermore, motivated by the integration of DNPUs with memristor crossbar arrays, we study the potential of using DNPUs in combination with linear layers.

This view has been held so strongly that few researchers have analysed single units to determine if this assumption is correct. However, recent results from psychology, neuroscience and computer science have shown the occasional existence of local codes emerging in artificial and biological neural networks. In this paper, we undertake the first systematic survey of when local codes emerge in a feed-forward neural network, using generated input and output data with known qualities. We find that the number of local codes that emerge from a NN follows a well-defined distribution across the number of hidden layer neurons, with a peak determined by the size of input data, number of examples presented and the sparsity of input data. Using a 1-hot output code drastically decreases the number of local codes on the hidden layer. The number of emergent local codes increases with the percentage of dropout applied to the hidden layer, suggesting that the localist encoding may offer a resilience to noisy networks. This data suggests that localist coding can emerge from feed-forward PDP networks and suggests some of the conditions that may lead to interpretable localist representations in the cortex.

The required modulation, expectedly so, becomes increasingly more complex, especially as the quantum computer becomes larger and runs faster, complicating the control hardware design. Here, we develop a simple method to essentially remove the pulse-modulation complexity at the cost of engineering the normal modes of the ion chain. We demonstrate that the required mode engineering is possible for a three ion chain, even with a trapped-ion quantum computational system built and optimized for a completely different mode of operations.

Hardware acceleration of deep networks is of paramount importance to ensure their ubiquitous presence in future computing platforms. Indeed, a major landmark that enables efficient hardware accelerators for deep networks is the recent advances from the machine learning community that have demonstrated the viability of aggressively scaled deep binary networks. In this paper, we demonstrate how deep binary networks can be accelerated in modified von Neumann machines by enabling binary convolutions within the static random access memory (SRAM) arrays. In general, binary convolutions consist of bit-wise exclusive-NOR (XNOR) operations followed by a population count (popcount). We present two proposals: one based on charge sharing approach to perform vector XNOR and approximate popcount and another based on bit-wise XNOR followed by a digital bit-tree adder for accurate popcount. We highlight the various tradeoffs in terms of circuit complexity, speed-up, and classification accuracy for both the approaches. Few key techniques presented as a part of the manuscript are the use of low-precision, low-overhead analog-to-digital converter (ADC), to achieve a fairly accurate popcount for the charge-sharing scheme and proposal for sectioning of the SRAM array by adding switches onto the read-bitlines, thereby achieving improved parallelism.

One key problem is the weights that are signed values. However, in a ReRAM crossbar, weights are stored as conductance of the crossbar cells, and the in-situ computation assumes all cells on each crossbar column are of the same sign. The current architectures either use two ReRAM crossbars for positive and negative weights (PRIME), or add an offset to weights so that all values become positive (ISAAC). Neither solution is ideal: they either double the cost of crossbars, or incur extra offset circuity. To better address this problem, we propose FORMS, a fine-grained ReRAM-based DNN accelerator with algorithm/hardware co-design. Instead of trying to represent the positive/negative weights, our key design principle is to enforce exactly what is assumed in the in-situ computation\u2014 ensuring that all weights in the same column of a crossbar have the same sign. It naturally avoids the cost of an additional crossbar. Such polarized weights can be nicely generated using alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) regularized optimization during the DNN training, which can exactly enforce certain patterns in DNN weights. To achieve high accuracy, we divide the crossbar into logical sub-arrays and only enforce this property within the fine-grained sub-array columns. Crucially, the small sub-arrays provides a unique opportunity for input zero-skipping, which can significantly avoid unnecessary computations and reduce computation time. At the same time, it also makes the hardware much easier to implement and is less susceptible to non-idealities and noise than coarse-grained architectures.

Abstract\u2014Millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications is considered as a key enabler towards the realization of next-generation wireless networks, due to the abundance of available spectrum at mmWave frequencies. However, mmWave suffers from high freespace path-loss and poor scattering resulting in mostly line-of-sight (LoS) channels which result in a lack of coverage. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), as a new paradigm, have the potential to fill the coverage holes by shaping the wireless channel. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for designing RIS with elements arranged in a uniform planar array (UPA) structure. In what we refer to as multi-beamforming, We propose and design RIS such that the reflected beam comprises multiple disjoint lobes. Moreover, the beams have optimized gain within the desired angular coverage with fairly sharp edges avoiding power leakage to other regions. We provide a closed-form low-complexity solution for the multi-beamforming design. We confirm our theoretical results by numerical analysis.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Nariman  Torkzaban", "Mohammad A. Khojastepour"], "year": 2021, "n_citations": 0}

Our experimental results on 12 workloads of the SPEC CPU2006 benchmark suite show that, when the cost asymmetry is 1:2, the proposed framework is capable of reducing the NVM programming cost by up to 24% more than leading compression approaches and by 12.5% more than the flip-and-write approach which selects between the data and its complement based on the programming cost.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Seyed Mohammad Seyedzadeh", "Alex K.

We give a distributed, local algorithm for convex hull formation and prove that it runs in O(B) asynchronous rounds, where B is the length of the object's boundary. Within the same asymptotic runtime, this algorithm can be extended to also form the object's (weak) O-hull, which uses the same number of particles but minimizes the area enclosed by the hull. Our algorithms are the first to compute convex hulls with distributed entities that have strictly local sensing, constant-size memory, and no shared sense of orientation or coordinates. Ours is also the first distributed approach to computing restricted-orientation convex hulls.

The proposed calculation model can be applied to any types of network structure including multi-layer feedforward networks. We also propose very large-scale integrated (VLSI) circuits to implement the proposed model. Unlike the conventional analog voltage or current mode circuits used in computing-in-memory circuits, our time-domain analog circuits use transient operation in charging/discharging processes to capacitors. Since the circuits can be designed without operational amplifiers, they can be operated with extremely low power consumption. However, they have to use very high-resistance devices, on the order of giga-ohms. We designed a CMOS VLSI chip to verify weighted-sum operation based on the proposed model with binary weights, which realizes the BinaryConnect model. In the chip, memory cells of static-random-access memory (SRAM) are used for synaptic connection weights. High-resistance operation was realized by using the subthreshold operation region of MOS transistors unlike the ordinary computing-in-memory circuits. The chip was designed and fabricated using a 250-nm fabrication technology. Measurement results showed that energy efficiency for the weighted-sum calculation was 300~TOPS/W (Tera-Operations Per Second per Watt), which is more than one order of magnitude higher than that in state-of-the-art digital AI processors, even though the minimum width of interconnection used in this chip was several times larger than that in such digital processors. If state-of-the-art VLSI technology is used to implement the proposed model, an energy efficiency of more than 1,000~TOPS/W will be possible.

Natural biochemical systems are typically modeled by chemical reaction networks (CRNs), and CRNs can be used as a specification language for synthetic chemical computation. In this paper, we identify a class of CRNs called non-competitive (NC) whose equilibria are absolutely robust to reaction rates and kinetic rate law, because their behavior is captured solely by their stoichiometric structure. Unlike prior work on rate-independent CRNs, checking non-competition and using it as a design criterion is easy and promises robust output. We also present a technique to program NC-CRNs using well-founded deep learning methods, showing a translation procedure from rectified linear unit (ReLU) neural networks to NC-CRNs. In the case of binary weight ReLU networks, our translation procedure is surprisingly tight in the sense that a single bimolecular reaction corresponds to a single ReLU node and vice versa. This compactness argues that neural networks may be a fitting paradigm for programming rate-independent chemical computation.

We show that the addition of duples allows for powerful behaviors of self-assembling systems at temperature 1, meaning systems which exclude the requirement of cooperative binding by tiles (i.e., the requirement that a tile must be able to bind to at least 2 tiles in an existing assembly if it is to attach). Cooperative binding is conjectured to be required in the standard aTAM for Turing universal computation and the efficient self-assembly of shapes, but we show that in the DaTAM these behaviors can in fact be exhibited at temperature 1. We then show that the DaTAM doesn't provide asymptotic improvements over the aTAM in its ability to efficiently build thin rectangles.

Hypervectors are D-dimensional (pseudo)random vectors with independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) components constituting ultra-wide holographic words: D=10,000 bits, for instance. At its very core, HD computing manipulates a set of seed hypervectors to build composite hypervectors representing objects of interest. It demands memory optimizations with simple operations for an efficient hardware realization. In this article, we propose hardware techniques for optimizations of HD computing, in a synthesizable open-source VHDL library, to enable co-located implementation of both learning and classification tasks on only a small portion of Xilinx UltraScale FPGAs: (1) We propose simple logical operations to rematerialize the hypervectors on the fly rather than loading them from memory. These operations massively reduce the memory footprint by directly computing the composite hypervectors whose individual seed hypervectors do not need to be stored in memory. (2) Bundling a series of hypervectors over time requires a multibit counter per every hypervector component. We instead propose a binarized back-to-back bundling without requiring any counters. This truly enables on-chip learning with minimal resources as every hypervector component remains binary over the course of training to avoid otherwise multibit components. (3) For every classification event, an associative memory is in charge of finding the closest match between a set of learned hypervectors and a query hypervector by using a distance metric. This operator is proportional to hypervector dimension (D), and hence may take O(D) cycles per classification event. Accordingly, we significantly improve the throughput of classification by proposing associative memories that steadily reduce the latency of classification to the extreme of a single cycle. (4) We perform a design space exploration incorporating the proposed techniques on FPGAs for a wearable biosignal processing application as a case study. Our techniques achieve up to 2.39\u00d7 area saving, or 2,337\u00d7 throughput improvement.

In this paper, a novel way of decreasing the ISI by defining a counting region on the spherical receiver\u2019s surface facing toward the transmitter node is proposed. The beneficial effect comes from the fact that the molecules received from the back lobe of the receiver are more likely to be coming through longer paths that contribute to ISI.

Our main theorem precisely characterizes the functions f that are stably computable by output-oblivious CRNs with an initial leader. The key necessary condition is that for sufficiently large inputs, f is the minimum of a finite number of nondecreasing quilt-affine functions (an affine function is linear with a constant offset; a quilt-affine function is linear with a periodic offset).", "venue": "Distributed Computing", "authors": ["Eric E.

The extraction of the trustworthiest way (namely, optimal social trust path (OSTP)) with multiple end-to-end quality of trust (QoT) constraints has been proved to be NP-Complete. Heuristic algorithms with polynomial and pseudo-polynomial-time complexities are often used to deal with this challenging problem. However, existing solutions cannot guarantee the efficiency of searching, that is, they can hardly avoid obtaining partial optimal solutions during searching process. Quantum annealing uses delocalization and tunneling to avoid falling into local minima without sacrifying execution time. It has been proved to be a promising way to many optimization problems in recently published literatures. In this paper, for the first time, QA based OSTP algorithms (QA_OSTP) is applied to the extraction of the trustworthiest way.

Despite decades of impressive Moore's Law performance scaling and other growth in the computing ecosystem there are nonetheless still important potential applications of computing that remain out of reach of current or foreseeable conventional computer systems. Specifically, there are computational applications whose complexity scales super-linearly, even exponentially, with the size of their input data such that the computation time or memory requirements for these problems become intractably large to solve for useful data input sizes. Such problems can have memory requirements that exceed what can be built on the most powerful supercomputers, and/or runtimes on the order of tens of years or more. Quantum computing (QC) is viewed by many as a possible future option for tackling these high-complexity or seemingly-intractable problems by complementing classical computing with a fundamentally different compute paradigm. \nThere is a huge gap between the problems for which a quantum computer might be useful and what we can currently build, program, and run. The goal of the QC research community is to close the gap such that useful algorithms can be run in practical amounts of time on reliable real-world QC hardware. In particular, the goal of this Computing Community Consortium (CCC) workshop was to articulate the central role that the computer science (CS) research communities plays in closing this gap.

Several studies introduced DNA based storage systems with high information density (petabytes/gram). However, DNA synthesis and sequencing technologies yield erroneous outputs. Algorithmic approaches for correcting these errors depend on reading multiple copies of each sequence and result in excessive reading costs. The unprecedented success of Transformers as a deep learning architecture for language modeling has led to its repurposing for solving a variety of tasks across various domains. In this work, we propose a novel approach for single-read reconstruction using an encoder-decoder Transformer architecture for DNA based data storage. We address the error correction process as a self-supervised sequence-tosequence task and use synthetic noise injection to train the model using only the decoded reads. Our approach exploits the inherent redundancy of each decoded file to learn its underlying structure. To demonstrate our proposed approach, we encode text, image and code-script files to DNA, produce errors with high-fidelity error simulator, and reconstruct the original files from the noisy reads. Our model achieves lower error rates when reconstructing the original data from a single read of each DNA strand compared to state-of-the-art algorithms using 2-3 copies.

PHEVs allow the driver to use electric power exclusively for driving and then switch to gasoline as needed. The more gasoline a vehicle uses, the higher cost is required for the trip. However, a PHEV cannot last for a long period on stored electricity without being recharged. Thus, it needs frequent recharging compared to traditional gasoline-powered vehicles. Moreover, the battery recharging time is usually long, which leads to longer delays on a trip. Therefore, it is necessary to provide a flexible navigation management scheme along with an efficient recharging schedule, which allows the driver to choose an optimal route based on the fuel-cost and time-to-destination constraints.

The synthesis framework is based on LUT networks (lookup-table networks), which play a key role in conventional logic synthesis. Establishing a connection between LUTs in a LUT network and reversible single-target gates in a reversible network allows us to bridge conventional logic synthesis with logic synthesis for quantum computing, despite several fundamental differences. We call our synthesis framework LUT-based Hierarchical Reversible Logic Synthesis (LHRS). Input to LHRS is a classical logic network; output is a quantum network (realized in terms of Clifford+$T$ gates). The framework offers to trade-off the number of qubits for the number of quantum gates. In a first step, an initial network is derived that only consists of single-target gates and already completely determines the number of qubits in the final quantum network. Different methods are then used to map each single-target gate into Clifford+$T$ gates, while aiming at optimally using available resources. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in automatically synthesizing IEEE compliant floating point networks up to double precision. As many quantum algorithms target scientific simulation applications, they can make rich use of floating point arithmetic components. But due to the lack of quantum circuit descriptions for those components, it can be difficult to find a realistic cost estimation for the algorithms. Our synthesized benchmarks provide cost estimates that allow quantum algorithm designers to provide the first complete cost estimates for a host of quantum algorithms.

Stochastic Computing (SC) is an emerging paradigm which replaces these conventional units with simple logic circuits and is particularly suitable for fault-tolerant applications. Spintronic devices, such as Magnetic Tunnel Junctions (MTJs), are capable of replacing CMOS in memory and logic circuits.

We propose approximating the synaptic weights in our MTJ-based NN implementation, in ways brought about by properties of our MTJ-SNG, to achieve energy-efficiency. We design an algorithm that can perform such approximations within a given error tolerance in a single-layer NN in an optimal way owing to the convexity of the problem formulation.

A universal tile set exists for any target shape (at scale factor 2), and from a genome assembly creates infinite copies of the genome as well as the target shape. An input target structure, on the other hand, can be \u201cdeconstructed\u201d by the universal tile set to form a genome encoding it, which will then replicate and also initiate the growth of copies of assemblies of the target shape.

In the medium-term, however, quantum machines will need to transition to greater reliability through error correction, likely through promising techniques like surface codes which are well suited for near-term devices with limited qubit connectivity. We discover quantum memory, particularly resonant cavities with transmon qubits arranged in a 2.5D architecture, can efficiently implement surface codes with substantial hardware savings and performance/fidelity gains. Specifically, we virtualize logical qubits by storing them in layers of qubit memories connected to each transmon.Surprisingly, distributing each logical qubit across many memories has a minimal impact on fault tolerance and results in substantially more efficient operations. Our design permits fast transversal application of CNOT operations between logical qubits sharing the same physical address (same set of cavities) which are 6x faster than standard lattice surgery CNOTs. We develop a novel embedding which saves approximately 10x in transmons with another 2x savings from an additional optimization for compactness.Although qubit virtualization pays a 10x penalty in serialization, advantages in the transversal CNOT and in area efficiency result in fault-tolerance and performance comparable to conventional 2D transmon-only architectures. Our simulations show our system can achieve fault tolerance comparable to conventional two-dimensional grids while saving substantial hardware. Furthermore, our architecture can produce magic states at 1.22x the baseline rate given a fixed number of transmon qubits. This is a critical benchmark for future fault-tolerant quantum computers as magic states are essential and machines will spend the majority of their resources continuously producing them.

Vector-by-matrix multiplication is the most prominent operation in these applications. Therefore, there is a critical need for compact and ultralow-power vector-by-matrix multiplier (VMM) blocks to perform resource-intensive low-to-moderate precision computations. To this end, in this article, we propose a time-domain mixed-signal VMM exploiting a modified configuration of 1MOSFET-1RRAM (1T-1R) array. The proposed VMM overcomes the energy inefficiency of the current-mode VMM approaches based on RRAMs. A rigorous analysis of different nonideal factors affecting the computational precision indicates that the nonnegligible minimum cell currents, channel length modulation (CLM), and drain-induced barrier lowering (DIBL) are the dominant mechanisms degrading the precision of the proposed VMM. We also show that there exists a tradeoff between the computational precision, dynamic range, and the area- and energy-efficiency of the proposed VMM approach. Therefore, we provide the necessary design guidelines for optimizing the performance. Our preliminary results indicate that an effective computational precision of 6 bits is achievable owing to the inherent compensation effect in the modified 1T-1R blocks.

The training accuracy on this imminent analog hardware, however, strongly depends on the switching characteristics of the cross-point elements. One of the key requirements is that these resistive devices must change conductance in a symmetrical fashion when subjected to positive or negative pulse stimuli. Here, we present a new training algorithm, so-called the \u201cTiki-Taka\u201d algorithm, that eliminates this stringent symmetry requirement. We show that device asymmetry introduces an unintentional implicit cost term into the SGD algorithm, whereas in the \u201cTiki-Taka\u201d algorithm a coupled dynamical system simultaneously minimizes the original objective function of the neural network and the unintentional cost term due to device asymmetry in a self-consistent fashion. We tested the validity of this new algorithm on a range of network architectures such as fully connected, convolutional and LSTM networks. Simulation results on these various networks show that the accuracy achieved using the conventional SGD algorithm with symmetric (ideal) device switching characteristics is matched in accuracy achieved using the \u201cTiki-Taka\u201d algorithm with non-symmetric (non-ideal) device switching characteristics. Moreover, all the operations performed on the arrays are still parallel and therefore the implementation cost of this new algorithm on array architectures is minimal; and it maintains the aforementioned power and speed benefits.

Current research in neuromorphic hardware targets dramatic improvements to ANN performance by increasing energy efficiency, speed of operation, and even seeks to extend the utility of ANNs by natively adding functionality such as spiking operation. One promising neuromorphic hardware platform is based on superconductive electronics, which has the potential to incorporate all of these advantages at the device level in addition to offering the potential of near lossless communications both within the neuromorphic circuits as well as between disparate superconductive chips. Here we explore one of the fundamental brain-inspired architecture components, the fan-in and fan-out as realized in superconductive circuits based on Josephson junctions. From our calculations and WRSPICE simulations we find that the fan-out should be limited only by junction count and circuit size limitations, and we demonstrate results in simulation at a level of 1-to-10,000, similar to that of the human brain. We find that fan-in has more limitations, but a fan-in level on the order of a few 100-to-1 should be achievable based on current technology.

M3D-based network-on-chip (NoC) architectures can exploit these benefits by adopting tier partitioning for intra-router stages. However, conventional fabrication methods are infeasible for M3D-enabled designs due to temperature related issues. This has necessitated lower temperature and temperature-resilient techniques for M3D fabrication, leading to inferior performance of transistors in the top tier and interconnects in the bottom tier. The resulting inter-tier process variation leads to performance degradation of M3D-enabled NoCs.

The processor may stall for a considerable interval while waiting to access the data stored in the cache blocks in LLC, if there are no independent instructions to execute. To provide accelerated service to the critical loads requests from LLC, this work concentrates on leveraging the additional capacity offered by replacing SRAM-based L2 with Spin-Transfer Torque Random Access Memory (STT-RAM) to accommodate frequently accessed cache blocks in exclusive read mode in favor of reducing the overall read service time. Our proposed technique partitions L2 cache into two STT-RAM arrangements with different write performance and data retention time.

Considering its excellent capability in customizing the channel conditions via energyfocusing and energy-nulling, it is an ideal technique for enhancing wireless communication security and privacy, through the theories of physical layer security and covert communications, respectively. In this article, we first present some results on applying IRS to improve the average secrecy rate in wiretap channels, to enable perfect communication covertness, and to deliberately create extra randomness in wireless propagations for hiding active wireless transmissions. Then, we identify multiple challenges for future research to fully unlock the benefits offered by IRS in the context of physical layer security and covert communications. With the aid of extensive numerical studies, we demonstrate the necessity of designing the amplitudes of the IRS elements in wireless communications with the consideration of security and privacy, where the optimal values are not always 1 as commonly adopted in the literature.

Since stateof-the-art ray models can already efficiently simulate specular interactions (reflection, diffraction) and diffuse scattering, but not anomalous reradiation, we complement them with a Huygens principle approach implemented using either an integral formulation, or a simpler antenna-array-like formulation. The different scattering mechanisms are combined through a generalization of the Effective Roughness model using a suitable power conservation equation. Notably, multiple reradiation modes can be modeled through the proposed approach. In addition, we validate the overall model\u2019s accuracy by benchmarking it against several case studies available in the literature, either based on analytical models, full-wave simulations, or experimental measurements.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Vittorio  Degli-Esposti", "Enrico Maria Vitucci", "M.

The digital version of these machines [digital memcomputing machines or (DMMs)] is scalable, and is particularly suited to solve combinatorial optimization problems. One of its possible realizations is by means of standard electronic circuits, with and without memory. Since these elements are non-quantum, they can be described by ordinary differential equations. Therefore, the circuit representation of DMMs can also be simulated efficiently on our traditional computers. We have indeed previously shown that these simulations only require time and memory resources that scale linearly with the problem size when applied to finding a good approximation to the optimum of hard instances of the maximum-satisfiability problem. The state-of-the-art algorithms, instead, require exponential resources for the same instances. However, in that work, we did not push the simulations to the limit of the processor used. Since linear scalability at smaller problem sizes cannot guarantee linear scalability at much larger sizes, we have extended these results in a stress-test up to $64\\times 10^{6}$ variables (corresponding to about 1 billion literals), namely the largest case that we could fit on a single core of an Intel Xeon E5-2860 with 128 GB of dynamic random-access memory (DRAM).

We define a generalization of the abstract Tile Assembly Model (aTAM), such that a tile system consists of a collection of polyomino tiles, the Polyomino Tile Assembly Model (polyTAM), and investigate the computational powers of polyTAM systems at temperature 1, where attachment among tiles occurs without glue cooperation (i.e., without the enforcement that more than one tile already existing in an assembly must contribute to the binding of a new tile). Systems composed of the unit-square tiles of the aTAM at temperature 1 are believed to be incapable of Turing universal computation (while cooperative systems, with temperature > 1, are able). As our main result, we prove that for any polyomino P of size 3 or greater, there exists a temperature-1 polyTAM system containing only shape-P tiles that is computationally universal. Our proof leverages the geometric properties of these larger (relative to the aTAM) tiles and their abilities to effectively utilize geometric blocking of particular growth paths of assemblies, while allowing others to complete. In order to prove the computational powers of polyTAM systems, we also prove a number of geometric properties held by all polyominoes of size \u2265 3. \n \nTo round out our main result, we provide strong evidence that size-1 (i.e. aTAM tiles) and size-2 polyomino systems are unlikely to be computationally universal by showing that such systems are incapable of geometric bit reading, which is a technique common to all currently known temperature-1 computationally universal systems. We further show that larger polyminoes with a limited number of binding positions are unlikely to be computationally universal, as they are only as powerful as temperature-1 aTAM systems.

Practicable algorithms have simple implementations, yet their level of cooling is far from optimal; exhaustive algorithms, on the other hand, cool much better, and some even reach (asymptotically) an optimal level of cooling, but they are not practicable.

Many quantum algorithms make use of so-called oracles that implement Boolean functions and are queried with highly superposed input states in order to evaluate the implemented Boolean function for many different input patterns in parallel. To simplify or enable a realization of these oracles in quantum logic in the first place, the Boolean reversible functions to be realized usually need to be broken down into several non-reversible sub-functions. However, since quantum logic is inherently reversible, these sub-functions have to be realized in a reversible fashion by adding further qubits in order to make the output patterns distinguishable (a process that is also known as embedding). This usually results in a significant increase of the qubits required in total. In this work, we show how this overhead can be significantly reduced by utilizing coding. More precisely, we prove that one additional qubit is always enough to embed any non-reversible function into a reversible one by using a variable-length encoding of the output patterns. Moreover, we characterize those functions that do not require an additional qubit at all.

Several 3 party compilers are evolving to offer improved circuit depth and faster compilation time and better depth/gate count for large quantum circuits. These 3 parties, or just a certain release of an otherwise trustworthy compiler, may possibly be untrusted and this could lead to an adversary to Reverse Engineer (RE) the quantum circuit for extracting sensitive aspects e.g., circuit topology, program, and its properties. In this paper, we propose obfuscation of quantum circuits to hide the functionality. Quantum circuits have inherent margin between correct and incorrect outputs. Therefore, obfuscation (i.e., corruption of functionality) by inserting dummy gates is nontrivial. We insert dummy SWAP gates one at a time for maximum corruption of functionality before sending the quantum circuit to an untrusted compiler. If an untrusted party clones the design, they get incorrect functionality. The designer removes the dummy SWAP gate post-compilation to restore the correct functionality. Compared to a classical counterpart, the quantum chip does not reveal the circuit functionality. Therefore, an adversary cannot guess the SWAP gate and location or validate using an oracle model. Evaluation of realistic quantum circuit with or without SWAP insertion is impossible in classical computers. Therefore, we propose a metric-based SWAP gate insertion process. The objective of the metric is to ensure maximum corruption of functionality measured using Total Variation Distance (TVD). The proposed approach is validated using IBM default noisy simulation model. Our metric-based approach predicts the SWAP position to achieve TVD of up to 50%, and performs 7.5% better than average TVD, and performs within 12.3% of the best obtainable TVD for the benchmarks.

The robustness of rate-independent chemical computation makes it a promising target for bioengineering implementation. We show how a BinaryConnect neural network trained in silico using well-founded deep learning optimization techniques, can be compiled to an equivalent chemical reaction network, providing a novel molecular programming paradigm.

The architecture of this probabilistic computer is similar to a stochastic neural network with the p-bit playing the role of a binary stochastic neuron, but with one key difference: there is no sequencer used to enforce an ordering of p-bit updates, as is typically required. Instead, we explore sequencerless designs where all p-bits are allowed to flip autonomously and demonstrate that such designs can allow ultrafast operation unconstrained by available clock speeds without compromising the solution\u2019s fidelity. Based on experimental results from a hardware benchmark of the autonomous design and benchmarked device models, we project that a nanomagnetic implementation can scale to achieve petaflips per second with millions of neurons.

This new cell structure, referred to as flash threshold logic (FTL), uses floating gate (flash) transistors to realize the weights associated with a threshold function. The threshold voltages of the flash transistors serve as proxy for the weights. An FTL cell can be equivalently viewed as a multi-input, edge-triggered flipflop which computes a threshold function on a clock edge. Consequently it can used in automatic synthesis of ASICs. The use of flash transistors in the FTL cell allows programming of the weights after fabrication, thereby preventing discovery of its function by a foundry or by reverse engineering. This paper focuses on the design and characteristics of the FTL cell. We present a novel method for programming the weights of an FTL cell for a specified threshold function using a modified perceptron learning algorithm. The algorithm is further extended to select weights to maximize the robustness of the design in the presence of process variations. The FTL circuit was designed in 40nm technology and simulations with layout-extracted parasitics included, demonstrate significant improvements in area (79.7%), power (61.1%), and performance (42.5%) when compared to the equivalent implementations of the same function in conventional static CMOS design.

In terms of hardware, devices have become so small that we are struggling to eliminate the effects of thermodynamic fluctuations, which are unavoidable at the nanometer scale. In terms of software, our ability to imagine and program effective computational abstractions and implementations are clearly challenged in complex domains. In terms of systems, currently five percent of the power generated in the US is used to run computing systems - this astonishing figure is neither ecologically sustainable nor economically scalable.

This benchmark will also be available for quantum simulators, where it is able to assess the run-time and required memory that a simulator needs to run the applications of the QPack benchmark.

Towards a standard quantum benchmark Currently, quantum computing is making large steps to becoming a mature technology. More companies are developing their own quantum hardware for both research and preparing for practical deployment. The main challenges in the past years have been an abundance of practical applications for the few-qubit Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) quantum hardware and scaling the qubits and depth of the quantum hardware. For these reasons, quantum computing was not yet at the maturity for a useful quantum benchmark. Many quantum benchmarks have been developed, but these either aim at qubit level assessment or are lacking in practical usability. For a benchmark to be useful, the practical application of the quantum hardware needs to be reflected. For this a practical application is required and this was not yet achievable with current quantum hardware scales. Benchmarks at the component level (individual qubits, quantum logic gates) have been developed widely and are useful for the development of the hardware. This is however more aimed at basic quantum research rather than application [1]. This also serves a fundamentally different goal than a performance measure of quantum computers. Many different forms of quantum hardware are being used, without a clear dominating implementation. Each of these have different dynamics and metrics, and can therefore not be generalized [2]. For this reason, making a benchmark for low-level hardware aspects will not properly reflect its performance compared to other implementations of the quantum hardware. Furthermore, while benchmarks for single qubit operations have been developed [3\u20136], these performances do not accurately reflect quantum operations on larger scales. Noise levels, for example, are an important metric in single gate performance. The noise however, varies per gate and due to qubit entanglement will propagate unpredictably throughout the system [2, 7, 8]. This makes it impossible to use single gate noise performance to extrapolate for the entire system, while for classical computers this would have been possible. These difficulties in determining the performance will require abstraction from the low level performance and an application level benchmark is needed to properly verify the performance. Other benchmarks such as Random Benchmarking (RB) or quantum volume [9] are well known quantum benchmarks, but provide limited insight to practical use of quantum computers. RB is an example of a volumetric benchmark, which determines to which circuit depth, the quantum hardware can hold the required fidelity for a set number of qubits. RB can determine the fidelity for a random sequence of quantum gates, which should give a general idea of how the hardware performs. By using RB, or any other volumetric benchmark, the quantum volume can be determined. However, this gives little insight on the performance of a practical algorithm on the quantum hardware. Another challenge in developing a benchmark for quantum computing, is that there is no consensus on which metrics should be benchmarked to reflect 1 ar X iv :2 10 3. 17 19 3v 2 [ cs .E T ] 2 0 Se p 20 21 Problem Instance Library Quantum Optimizer", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Koen  Mesman", "Zaid  Al-Ars", "Matthias  M\u00f6ller"], "year": 2021, "n_citations": 0}

The standard way to train these models resorts to an iterative unsupervised procedure based on Gibbs sampling, called \"contrastive divergence\", and additional supervised tuning via back-propagation. However, this procedure has been shown not to follow any gradient and can lead to suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we show an efficient alternative to contrastive divergence by means of simulations of digital memcomputing machines (DMMs) that compute the gradient of the log-likelihood involved in unsupervised training. We test our approach on pattern recognition using a modified version of the MNIST data set of hand-written numbers. DMMs sample effectively the vast phase space defined by the probability distribution of RBMs, and provide a good approximation close to the optimum. This efficient search significantly reduces the number of generative pretraining iterations necessary to achieve a given level of accuracy in the MNIST data set, as well as a total performance gain over the traditional approaches. In fact, the acceleration of the pretraining achieved by simulating DMMs is comparable to, in number of iterations, the recently reported hardware application of the quantum annealing method on the same network and data set. Notably, however, DMMs perform far better than the reported quantum annealing results in terms of quality of the training. Finally, we also compare our method to recent advances in supervised training, like batch-normalization and rectifiers, that seem to reduce the advantage of pretraining. We find that the memcomputing method still maintains a quality advantage (>1% in accuracy, corresponding to a 20% reduction in error rate) over these approaches, despite the network pretrained with memcomputing defines a more non-convex landscape using sigmoidal activation functions without batch-normalization. Our approach is agnostic about the connectivity of the network. Therefore, it can be extended to train full Boltzmann machines, and even deep networks at once.", "venue": "Neural Networks", "authors": ["Haik  Manukian", "Fabio L.

While PCM achieves high read throughput and low standby power, the critical concerns are its poor write performance and limited durability, especially when compared to DRAM. A naturally inspired design is the hybrid memory architecture that fuses DRAM and PCM, so as to exploit the positive aspects of both types of memory. Unfortunately, existing solutions are seriously challenged by the limited main memory size, which is the primary bottleneck of in-memory computing. In this paper, we introduce a novel Content Aware hybrid PCM/DRAM main memory system framework - CARAM, which exploits deduplication to improve line sharing with high memory efficiency. CARAM effectively reduces write traffic to hybrid memory by removing unnecessary duplicate line writes. It also substantially extends available free memory space by coalescing redundant lines in hybrid memory, thereby further improving the wear-leveling efficiency of PCM. To obtain high data access performance, we also design a set of acceleration techniques to minimize the overhead caused by extra computation costs. Our experiment results show that CARAM effectively reduces 15%~42% of memory usage and improves I/O bandwidth by 13%~116%, while saving 31%~38% energy consumption, compared to the state-of-the-art of hybrid systems.", "venue": "NPC", "authors": ["Yinjin  Fu"], "year": 2020, "n_citations": 0}

This result derives from the recent finding that any stochastic differential equation possesses a topological supersymmetry, and the realization that the solution search by a DMM proceeds via an instantonic phase. Certain TFT correlators in DMMs then reveal the presence of a transient long-range order both in space and time, associated with the effective breakdown of the topological supersymmetry by instantons. The ensuing non-locality and the low dimensionality of instantons are the physical reasons why DMMs can solve complex problems efficiently, despite their non-quantum character.
