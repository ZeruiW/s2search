Reachability for UTA is undecidable in general. Various subclasses with decidable reachability have been studied. A generic approach to UTA reachability consists of two phases: first, a static analysis of the automaton is performed to compute a set of clock constraints at each state; in the second phase, reachable sets of configurations, called zones, are enumerated. In this work, we improve the algorithm for the static analysis. Compared to the existing algorithm, our method computes smaller sets of constraints and guarantees termination for more UTA, making reachability faster and more effective.

Here, depending on certain closure properties of the fragment, C is the family of arbitrary, non-erasing, length-preserving, length-multiplying, or length-reducing morphisms. In particular, definability in a certain fragment can often be characterized in terms of the syntactic morphism. This work extends a result of Straubing in which he investigated certain restrictions of first-order logic formulae. In contrast to Straubing's model-theoretic approach, our notion of a logical fragment is purely syntactic and it does not rely on Ehrenfeucht-Fraisse games. \nAs motivating examples, we present (1) a fragment which captures the stutter-invariant part of piecewise-testable languages and (2) an acyclic fragment of Sigma_2.

Labeled failures are a conservative extension of PEGs that adds an error reporting mechanism for PEG parsers, and these labels can also be associated with recovery expressions to provide an error recovery mechanism. These expressions can use the full expressivity of PEGs to recover from syntactic errors. \nManually annotating a large grammar with labels and recovery expressions can be difficult. In this work, we present two approaches, Standard and Unique, to automatically annotate a PEG with labels, and to build their corresponding recovery expressions. The Standard approach annotates a grammar in a way similar to manual annotation, but it may insert labels incorrectly, while the Unique approach is more conservative to annotate a grammar and does not insert labels incorrectly. \nWe evaluate both approaches by using them to generate error recovering parsers for four programming languages: Titan, C, Pascal and Java. In our evaluation, the parsers produced using the Standard approach, after a manual intervention to remove the labels incorrectly added, gave an acceptable recovery for at least 70% of the files in each language.

In a distributed algorithm, an arbitrary number of processes cooperate to achieve a common goal (e.g., elect a leader). Processes have unique identifiers (pids) from an infinite, totally ordered domain. An algorithm proceeds in synchronous rounds, each round allowing a process to perform a bounded sequence of actions such as send or receive a pid, store it in some register, and compare register contents wrt. the associated total order. An algorithm is supposed to be correct independently of the number of processes. To specify correctness properties, we introduce a logic that can reason about processes and pids. Referring to leader election, it may say that, at the end of an execution, each process stores the maximum pid in some dedicated register. Since the verification of distributed algorithms is undecidable, we propose an underapproximation technique, which bounds the number of rounds. This is an appealing approach, as the number of rounds needed by a distributed algorithm to conclude is often exponentially smaller than the number of processes. We provide an automata-theoretic solution, reducing model checking to emptiness for alternating two-way automata on words.

As a consequence, timed automata are in general non-determinizable. This is unfortunate since deterministic automata play a major role in model-based testing, observability and implementability. However, by bounding the length of the traces in the automaton, effective determinization becomes possible. We propose a novel procedure for bounded determinization of timed automata. The procedure unfolds the automata to bounded trees, removes all silent transitions and determinizes via disjunction of guards. The proposed algorithms are optimized to the bounded setting and thus are more efficient and can handle a larger class of timed automata than the general algorithms. We show how to apply the approach in a fault-based test-case generation method, called model-based mutation testing, that was previously restricted to deterministic timed automata.

A tower controller would be making many decisions in real-time to sequence aircraft.

This is due to the very dynamic nature of the environment. The objective of this paper is to test the hypothesis that one can learn from the sequence adopted by the controller some strategies that can act as heuristics in decision support tools for aircraft sequencing. This aim is tested in this paper by attempting to learn sequences generated from a well-known sequencing method that is being used in the real world.

However, an issue of neural network-based adversaries is that integrating system requirements without handcrafting sophisticated reward signals are difficult.

A natural decision problem follows: given a language definition, can a user always disambiguate an ambiguous program? We introduce and formalize this fundamental problem - called the resolvable ambiguity problem - and divide it into separate static and dynamic resolvability problems. We provide solutions to the static problem for a restricted language class and sketch proofs of soundness and completeness.

In this report, we have used a PRES+ model (Petri net based Representation for Embedded Systems) as an extension of classical Petri net model that captures concurrency, timing behaviour of embedded systems; it allows systems to be representative in different levels of abstraction and improves expressiveness by allowing the token to carry information. Modeling using PRES+, as discussed above, may be convenient for specifying the input behaviour because it supports concurrency. However, there is no equivalence checking method reported in the literature for PRES+ models to the best of our knowledge. In contrast, equivalence checking of FSMD models exist. As a first step, therefore, we seek to devise an algorithm to translate PRES+ models to FSMD models and we seek to hand execute our algorithm on a real life example and we have to translate two versions of PRES+ models to FSMD models.

Moreover, we state a Kleene-like theorem characterising the regular morphisms category in terms of the smallest subcategory closed under certain operations. Additionally, whenever the branching type monad is taken to be the powerset monad, we show that regular maps are described as maps recognized by certain functors whose codomains are categories with all finite hom-sets. \nWe instantiate our framework on classical non-deterministic automata, tree automata, fuzzy automata and weighted automata.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Tomasz  Brengos", "Marco  Peressotti"], "year": 2019, "n_citations": 0}

The primary motivation comes from the study of logics for querying graph topology, which have recently found numerous applications. Such logics use conditions on paths expressed by regular languages and relations, but they often need to be extended by rational relations such as subword or subsequence. Evaluating formulae in such extended graph logics boils down to checking nonemptiness of the intersection of rational relations with regular or recognizable relations (or, more generally, to the gener- alized intersection problem, asking whether some projections of a regular relation have a nonempty intersection with a given rational relation). We prove that for several basic and commonly used rational relations, the intersec- tion problem with regular relations is either undecidable (e.g., for subword or sux, and some generalizations), or decidable with non-primitive-recursive complexity (e.g., for sub- sequence and its generalizations). These results are used to rule out many classes of graph logics that freely combine regular and rational relations, as well as to provide the sim- plest problem related to verifying lossy channel systems that has non-primitive-recursive complexity. We then prove a dichotomy result for logics combining regular conditions on individual paths and rational relations on paths, by showing that the syntactic form of formulae classies them into either eciently checkable or undecidable cases. We also give examples of rational relations for which such logics are decidable even without syntactic restrictions.", "venue": "Log. Methods Comput.

Since the heads of a WK automaton may read longer strings in a transition, in previous models a so-called sensing parameter took care for the proper meeting of the heads (not allowing to read the same positions of the input in the last step).

As most real systems are in some sense distributed or concurrent, one has to decide how to model concurrency. Broadly, there are two schools: the interleaving approach imposes a global \u2018clock\u2019 on the system, and says that independent concurrent events occur in some order, but that order is arbitrary \u2013 encapsulated by the CCS interleaving law a|b = a.b+ b.a. \u2018True concurrency\u2019, on the other hand, represents concurrency explicitly in the semantics of the system, as exemplified by Petri nets. There are many arguments about the merits, ranging from the practical \u2013 e.g. that true concurrent models avoid the exponential state explosion arising from arbitrary interleaving \u2013 to the philosophical \u2013 one should understand concurrency in its own right. Another extension of classical computation is probability, whether used to model genuine randomness, or uncertainty. Probabilistic models have in the last two or three decades also been the subject of intensive research, and by now there are many widely used tools for practical verification of probabilistic systems, based on a range of different theoretical models. A small selection of established models and systems might be [16, 15, 22, 14, 26, 18, 5, 3]. Such work adopts the \u2018interleaving\u2019 approach to concurrency \u2013 that is, from the true concurrency proponent\u2019s point of view, it ignores concurrency. The topic of this paper is the combination of probability with true concurrency. As well as the core interleaving vs. true concurrency distinction, there is another crucial difference between the two in the probabilistic framework: in probability, one cares about the probabilistic (in)dependence of events, and in true concurrency this relation is (at least) correlated with, and ideally derived from, the concurrency relation. To put it another way, temporal stochastic processes and models capturing concurrency through nondeterminism such as [12, 6, 16, 17, 7] have a global state corresponding to a global time. In a distributed system, however, this is neither feasible nor natural. Thus, in true concurrency approaches there is no notion of global time or state, but rather local ones. In other words, the local components have their own local states and act in their own local time until they communicate together. This results in a highly desirable match between concurrency and probability, so that concurrent choices can be made probabilistically independent. There is some work, quite recently, on probabilistic true concurrency models [23, 9, 20, 21, 4, 1, 2], but this is still at the foundational semantic stage, and there are very few no true concurrent probabilistic temporal logics \u2013 a recent example in the setting of distributed Markov chains is in [10]. Therefore, in [8] the first author aimed to develop a probabilistic temporal logic suitable for application to Petri nets, which are one of the best known true concurrent models, even though often used with a forced interleaving semantics. As part of this programme, it was necessary first to extend lower-level models, which is the work reported here.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Nargess  Ghahremani", "Julian  Bradfield"], "year": 2020, "n_citations": 0}

A Graph Embedding Approach", "abstract": "It can be shown that each permutation group $G \\sqsubseteq S_n$ can be embedded, in a well defined sense, in a connected graph with $O(n+|G|)$ vertices. Some groups, however, require much fewer vertices. For instance, $S_n$ itself can be embedded in the $n$-clique $K_n$, a connected graph with n vertices. In this work, we show that the minimum size of a context-free grammar generating a finite permutation group $G \\sqsubseteq S_n$ can be upper bounded by three structural parameters of connected graphs embedding $G$: the number of vertices, the treewidth, and the maximum degree. More precisely, we show that any permutation group $G \\sqsubseteq S_n$ that can be embedded into a connected graph with $m$ vertices, treewidth k, and maximum degree $\\Delta$, can also be generated by a context-free grammar of size $2^{O(k\\Delta\\log\\Delta)}\\cdot m^{O(k)}$. By combining our upper bound with a connection between the extension complexity of a permutation group and the grammar complexity of a formal language, we also get that these permutation groups can be represented by polytopes of extension complexity $2^{O(k \\Delta\\log \\Delta)}\\cdot m^{O(k)}$. The above upper bounds can be used to provide trade-offs between the index of permutation groups, and the number of vertices, treewidth and maximum degree of connected graphs embedding these groups. In particular, by combining our main result with a celebrated $2^{\\Omega(n)}$ lower bound on the grammar complexity of the symmetric group $S_n$ we have that connected graphs of treewidth $o(n/\\log n)$ and maximum degree $o(n/\\log n)$ embedding subgroups of $S_n$ of index $2^{cn}$ for some small constant $c$ must have $n^{\\omega(1)}$ vertices.

The security property that the system must satisfy is a non-interference property. Intuitively, non-interference ensures the absence of any causal dependency from a high-level domain to a lower level domain. Various notions of non-interference have been defined in the literature, and in this paper, we focus on strong non-deterministic non-interference (SNNI) and two (bi)simulation-based variants thereof (cosimulation-based SNNI and bisimulation-based SNNI). These properties and their extensions have been mostly studied in the context of discrete event systems, while it is now well-known that time is an important attack vector against secure systems. At the same time, there is an obvious interest in going beyond simple verification to control problems: to be able to automatically make systems secure. We consider non-interference properties in the challenging setting of control of dense-time systems specified by timed automata and we study the two following problems: (1) check whether it is possible to find a sub-system so that it is non-interferent; if yes, (2) compute a (largest) sub-system which is non-interferent.

This approach has two shortcomings: Recent work in distributed computing is shifting towards dynamically changing communication networks rather than static ones, and an important class of distributed algorithms are so-called full-information protocols, where nodes piggy-pack previously received messages onto current messages. In this work we consider the synthesis problem for a system of two nodes communicating in rounds over a dynamic link whose message size is not bounded. Given a network model, i.e., a set of link directions, in each round of the execution, the adversary choses a link from the network model, restricted only by the specification, and delivers messages according to the current link's directions.

A hybrid automata (HA) is a well known and widely used formal model for the specification of such systems.

If this were feasible, it would enable the design of a plant-on-a-chip (PoC) system that could be used for the emulation of the plant to validate discrete controllers. Such an approach would need to be mathematically sound and should not rely on numerical solvers. We propose a method of PoC design for plant emulation, not possible before.

The motivation for GFG automata comes from their adequacy for games and synthesis, wherein general nondeterminism is inappropriate. We continue the ongoing effort of studying the power of nondeterminism in GFG automata. Initial indications have hinted that every GFG automaton embodies a deterministic one. Today we know that this is not the case, and in fact GFG automata may be exponentially more succinct than deterministic ones. \nWe focus on the typeness question, namely the question of whether a GFG automaton with a certain acceptance condition has an equivalent GFG automaton with a weaker acceptance condition on the same structure. Beyond the theoretical interest in studying typeness, its existence implies efficient translations among different acceptance conditions. This practical issue is of special interest in the context of games, where the Buchi and co-Buchi conditions admit memoryless strategies for both players. Typeness is known to hold for deterministic automata and not to hold for general nondeterministic automata. \nWe show that GFG automata enjoy the benefits of typeness, similarly to the case of deterministic automata. In particular, when Rabin or Streett GFG automata have equivalent Buchi or co-Buchi GFG automata, respectively, then such equivalent automata can be defined on a substructure of the original automata. Using our typeness results, we further study the place of GFG automata in between deterministic and nondeterministic ones. Specifically, considering automata complementation, we show that GFG automata lean toward nondeterministic ones, admitting an exponential state blow-up in the complementation of a Streett automaton into a Rabin automaton, as opposed to the constant blow-up in the deterministic case.", "venue": "FSTTCS", "authors": ["Udi  Boker", "Orna  Kupferman", "Michal  Skrzypczak"], "year": 2017, "n_citations": 15}

Actually, we show that the problem is decidable in polynomial time if the input is specified by DFAs. Furthermore, we prove that the hairpin completion of regular languages is an unambiguous linear context-free language. Beforehand, it was known only that it is linear context-free. Unambiguity is a strong additional property because it allows to compute the growth function or the topological entropy. In particular, we can compare the growth of the hairpin completion with the growth of the defining regular languages. We show that the growth of the hairpin completion is exponential if and only if the growth of the underlying languages is exponential. Even if both growth functions are exponential, they can be as far apart as 2^@Q^(^n^) for the hairpin completion and 2^@Q^(^n^) for the defining regular languages. However, if the hairpin completion is still regular, then the hairpin completion and its underlying language have essentially the same growth and same topological entropy.", "venue": "Inf.

In addition to providing the basic functionalities of knowledge graphs, dependent types add expressiveness in encoding both entities and queries, explainability in answers to queries through witnesses, and compositionality and automation in the construction of witnesses. Using the Coq proof assistant, we demonstrate how to build and query dependently typed knowledge graphs as a proof of concept for future works in this direction.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Zhangsheng  Lai", "Aik Beng Ng", "Liang Ze Wong", "Simon  See", "Shaowei  Lin"], "year": 2020, "n_citations": 0}

Let S be an abstract numeration system. When the numeration language L is prefix-closed and regular, a sequence is said to be S-regular if the module generated by its S-kernel is finitely generated. In this paper, we give a new characterization of such sequences in terms of the underlying numeration tree T (L) whose nodes are words of L. We may decorate these nodes by the sequence of interest following a breadth-first enumeration. For a prefix-closed regular language L, we prove that a sequence is S-regular if and only if the tree T (L) decorated by the sequence is linear, i.e., the decoration of a node depends linearly on the decorations of a fixed number of ancestors. Next, we introduce and study regular sequences in a rational base numeration system, whose numeration language is known to be highly non-regular. We motivate and comment our definition that a sequence is p q -regular if the underlying numeration tree decorated by the sequence is linear. We give the first few properties of such sequences, we provide a few examples of them, and we propose a method for guessing p q -regularity.

We propose two ways of approaching it by constraining the search space of deterministic WA: k-delay and r-regret. A WA N is k-delay determinizable if there exists a deterministic automaton D that defines the same function as N and for all words \u03b1 in the language of N, the accepting run of D on \u03b1 is always at most k-away from a maximal accepting run of N on \u03b1. That is, along all prefixes of the same length, the absolute difference between the running sums of weights of the two runs is at most k. A WA N is r-regret determinizable if for all words \u03b1 in its language, its non-determinism can be resolved on the fly to construct a run of N such that the absolute difference between its value and the value assigned to \u03b1 by N is at most r. We show that a WA is determinizable if and only if it is k-delay determinizable for some k. Hence deciding the existence of some k is as difficult as the general determinization problem.

This property has recently found applications in data visualization [16, 20], social network and data analysis [21, 3]. However, numerical precision errors are a serious issue in computational hyperbolic geometry. Since the area and circumference of a circle of radius r is exponential, any coordinate system based on a fixed tuple of coordinates will fail to distinguish two points in distance 1 already in distance proportional to the number of bits used to represent the coordinates. One way to handle this issue is to use tessellations [14]. Hyperbolic tessellations can be generated combinatorically, avoiding the numerical issues altogether, and have many applications by themselves, e.g., in art [6], game design [13], data visualization [5]. Of course, tessellations are also a beautiful area of pure mathematics. While combinatorial structures for simple hyperbolic tessellations, such as the order-3 heptagonal tessellation [12] is relatively straightforward, finding them for arbitrary tessellations is a challenging problem.

Previous grammar-based tree compressors were not analyzed for the worst-case size of the computed grammar, except for the top dag of Bille et al., for which only the weaker upper bound of $O\\big(\\frac{n}{\\log_\\sigma^{0.19} n}\\big)$ (which was very recently improved to $O\\big(\\frac{n \\cdot \\log \\log_\\sigma n}{\\log_\\sigma n}\\big)$ by H\\\"ubschle-Schneider and Raman) for unranked and unlabelled trees has been derived. The main result is used to show that every arithmetical formula of size $n$, in which only $m \\leq n$ different variables occur, can be transformed (in linear time as well as in logspace) into an arithmetical circuit of size $O\\big(\\frac{n \\cdot \\log m}{\\log n}\\big)$ and depth $O(\\log n)$. This refines a classical result of Brent from 1974, according to which an arithmetical formula of size $n$ can be transformed into a logarithmic depth circuit of size $O(n)$.", "venue": "FSTTCS", "authors": ["Danny  Hucke", "Markus  Lohrey", "Eric  N\u00f6th"], "year": 2014, "n_citations": 21}

While it is known that there exist pseudovarieties with NP-complete or even undecidable membership problems, for many well-known pseudovarieties the problem is known to be decidable in polynomial time. We show that for many of these pseudovarieties, the membership problem is actually in AC^0. To this end, we show that these pseudovarieties can be characterized by first-order sentences with multiplication as the only predicate. We prove closure properties of the class of pseudovarieties with such first-order descriptions under various well-known operations; in particular, if V can be described by a first-order sentence, then DV, LV, and the Mal'cev products of K, D, N, LI, and LG with V are first-order definable as well. Moreover, if H is a first-order definable pseudovariety of finite groups, then the pseudovariety of all finite semigroups whose subgroups are in H is first-order definable. Our logical formalism can be extended by a predicate corresponding to the omega-operator in semigroups. The extended logic is powerful enough to capture all finitely based pseudovarieties, i.e., pseudovarieties characterized by some finite set of pseudoidentities, and yields decidability of membership in L, in FOLL (polynomial-size Boolean circuits of O(log log n) depth) and in qAC^0 (Boolean circuits of constant depth and quasi-polynomial size). In view of lower bounds from circuit complexity, we obtain a new technique to prove that a pseudovariety V is not finitely based: if membership in V is hard for PARITY, it cannot be defined in this extended logic and thus does not admit a finite basis.

It refines differential privacy, the current gold standard in data privacy, by allowing explicit prior knowledge in privacy analysis. Through these privacy frameworks, a number of privacy mechanisms have been developed in literature. In practice, privacy mechanisms often need be modified or adjusted to specific applications. Their privacy risks have to be re-evaluated for different circumstances. Moreover, computing devices only approximate continuous noises through floating-point computation, which is discrete in nature. Privacy proofs can thus be complicated and prone to errors. Such tedious tasks can be burdensome to average data curators. In this paper, we propose an automatic verification technique for Pufferfish privacy. We use hidden Markov models to specify and analyze discretized Pufferfish privacy mechanisms. We show that the Pufferfish verification problem in hidden Markov models is NP-hard. Using Satisfiability Modulo Theories solvers, we propose an algorithm to analyze privacy requirements.

Nested weighted automata extend weighted automata and consist of a master automaton and a set of slave automata that are invoked by the master automaton. Nested weighted automata are strictly more expressive than weighted automata (e.g., average response time can be expressed with nested weighted automata), but the basic decision questions have higher complexity (e.g., for deterministic automata, the emptiness question for nested weighted automata is PSPACE-hard, whereas the corresponding complexity for weighted automata is PTIME). We consider a natural subclass of nested weighted automata where at any point at most a bounded number k of slave automata can be active. We focus on automata whose master value function is the limit average. We show that these nested weighted automata with bounded width are strictly more expressive than weighted automata (e.g., average response time with no overlapping requests can be expressed with bound k=1, but not with non-nested weighted automata). We show that the complexity of the basic decision problems (i.e., emptiness and universality) for the subclass with k constant matches the complexity for weighted automata.

The resulting graph grammar algebra has the following properties: (1) The product and commutator of two such operators is a sum of such operators with integer coefficients. Thus, the algebra and the Lie algebra occurs entirely at the structural (or graph-combinatorial) level of graph grammar rules, lifted from the level of elementary creation/annihilation operators (an improvement over [1], Propositions 1 and 2).

This model can overcome the reversibility restriction by exploiting the garbage tape to store popped symbols. We show that the proposed model can simulate any quantum pushdown automaton with a classical stack as well as any probabilistic pushdown automaton.

Despite significant advancements, however, performance scaling remains the Achilles\u2019 heel of this field. A key idea used in modern counters is to count models projected on an independent support that is often a small subset of the projection set, i.e. original set of variables on which we wanted to project. While this idea has been effective in scaling performance, the question of whether it can benefit to count models projected on variables beyond the projection set, has not been explored. In this paper, we study this question and show that contrary to intuition, it can be beneficial to project on variables beyond the projection set. In applications such as verification of binarized neural networks, quantification of information flow, reliability of power grids etc., a good upper bound of the projected model count often suffices. We show that in several such cases, we can identify a set of variables, called upper bound support (UBS), that is not necessarily a subset of the projection set, and yet counting models projected on UBS guarantees an upper bound of the true projected model count. Theoretically, a UBS can be exponentially smaller than the smallest independent support. Our experiments show that even otherwise, UBS-based projected counting can be more efficient than independent support-based projected counting, while yielding bounds of very high quality. Based on extensive experiments, we find that UBS-based projected counting can solve many problem instances that are beyond the reach of a state-ofthe-art independent support-based projected model counter.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Jiong  Yang", "Supratik  Chakraborty", "Kuldeep S.

One extension that has received a lot of interest is timed automata with a, possibly unbounded, stack, also called pushdown timed automata (PDTA). While different algorithms have been given for reachability in different variants of this model, most of these results are purely theoretical and do not give rise to efficient implementations. One main reason for this is that none of these algorithms (and the implementations that exist) use the so-called zone-based abstraction, but rely either on the region-abstraction or other approaches, which are significantly harder to implement.In this paper, we show that a naive extension, using simulations, of the zone based reachability algorithm for the control state reachability problem of timed automata is not sound in the presence of a stack. To understand this better we give an inductive rule based view of the zone reachability algorithm for timed automata. This alternate view allows us to analyze and adapt the rules to also work for pushdown timed automata. We obtain the first zone-based algorithm for PDTA which is terminating, sound and complete.

A key aspect of this approach is that rather than explicitly inferring a grammar that describes the format, the neural network learns to perform various parsing actions (such as merging two tokens) over a corpus of sentences, with the goal of maximizing the total reward, which is roughly based on the estimated frequency of the resulting parse structures. This can allow the learning process to more easily explore different action choices, since a given choice may change the optimality of the parse (as expressed by the total reward), but will not result in the failure to parse a sentence. However, the approach also exhibits limitations: first, the neural network does not provide production rules for the grammar that it uses during parsing; second, because this neural network can successfully parse any sentence, it cannot be directly used to identify sentences that deviate from the format of the training sentences, i.e., that are anomalous. In this paper, we address these limitations by presenting procedures for extracting production rules from the neural network, and for using these rules to determine whether a given sentence is nominal or anomalous, when compared to structures observed within training data. In the latter case, an attempt is made to identify the location of the anomaly. Additionally, a two pass mechanism is presented for dealing with formats containing high-entropy information. We empirically evaluate the approach on artificial formats, demonstrating effectiveness, but also identifying limitations.

To this aim, we study the problem of model checking component-based asynchronously communicating systems in the presence of an unspecified component against safety properties. Our solution is based on assume-guarantee reasoning, adopted for asynchronous environments, which generates the weakest assumption. If the newly added component conforms to the assumption, then the whole system still satisfies the property. To make the approach efficient and convergent, we produce an overapproximated interface of the missing component and by its composition with the rest of the system components, we achieve an overapproximated specification of the system, from which we remove those traces of the system that violate the property and generate an assumption for the missing component.

We argue that this model is useful for expressing lexicalized syntax in computational linguistics. We compare the input languages, which are the languages traditionally considered in automata theory, to the so-called basic and h-proper languages, which are (implicitly) used by categorial grammars, the original tool for the description of lexicalized syntax. The basic and h-proper languages allow us to stress several nice properties of h-lexicalized restarting automata, and they are suitable for modeling the analysis by reduction and, subsequently, for the development of categories of a lexicalized syntax. Based on the fact that a two-way deterministic monotone restarting automaton can be transformed into an equivalent deterministic monotone RL-automaton in (Marcus) contextual form, we obtain a transformation from monotone RLWW-automata that recognize the class CFL of context-free languages as their input languages to deterministic monotone h-RLWW-automata that recognize CFL through their h-proper languages. Through this transformation we obtain automata with the complete correctness preserving property and an infinite hierarchy within CFL, based on the size of the read/write window. Additionally, we consider h-RLWW-automata that are allowed to perform multiple rewrite steps per cycle, and we establish another infinite hierarchy above CFL that is based on the number of rewrite steps that may be executed within a cycle. The corresponding separation results and their proofs illustrate the transparency of h-RLWW-automata that work with the (complete or cyclic) correctness preserving property", "venue": "AFL", "authors": ["Martin  Pl\u00e1tek", "Friedrich  Otto"], "year": 2017, "n_citations": 3}

A configuration is a state and a value for each counter; a transition changes the state and each counter is incremented, decremented, or left unchanged. While qualitative properties such as state and configuration reachability have been studied for VASS, we consider the long-run average cost of infinite computations of VASS. The cost of a configuration is for each state, a linear combination of the counter values. In the special case of uniform cost functions, the linear combination is the same for all states. The (regular) long-run emptiness problem is, given a VASS, a cost function, and a threshold value, if there is a (lasso-shaped) computation such that the long-run average value of the cost function does not exceed the threshold. For uniform cost functions, we show that the regular long-run emptiness problem is (a)~decidable in polynomial time for integer-valued VASS, and (b)~decidable but nonelementarily hard for natural-valued VASS (i.e., nonnegative counters). For general cost functions, we show that the problem is (c)~NP-complete for integer-valued VASS, and (d)~undecidable for natural-valued VASS. Our most interesting result is for (c) integer-valued VASS with general cost functions, where we establish a connection between the regular long-run emptiness problem and quadratic Diophantine inequalities.

We show how to generate all these strings for each n and k, and how its enumeration provides an alternative way to obtain the exact number of ICDFA\u2019s. 1 Motivation In symbolic manipulation environments for finite automata, it is important to have an adequate representation of automata and, dependent upon their use, several representations may be available. For example, for testing if two finite automata are isomorphic objects or for (random) generation of automata, the representation must be compact and somehow canonical. In the FAdo project [MR05a, fad] a canonical form is used to test if two minimal DFA\u2019s are isomorphic (i.e are the same up to renaming of states). In this paper we prove the correctness of that representation and show how it can be used for the exact enumeration and generation of initially connected deterministic finite automata (ICDFA). The problem of enumeration of finite automata was considered by several authors since early 1960s, in particular see Harrison [Har65], Robinson [Rob85], Harary and Palmer [HP67] and Liskovets [Lis69] amongst many others. A survey may be found in Domaratzki et al. [DKS02]. More recently, several authors examined related problems. Domaratzki et al. [DKS02] studied the enumeration of distinct languages accepted by finite automata with n states; Nicaud [Nic99], Champarnaud and Paranthoen [CP05, Par04] and Bassino and Nicaud [BN] analysed several aspects of the average behaviour of regular languages; Liskovets [Lis03] and Domaratzki [Dom04] gave (exact and asymptotic) enumerations of acyclic DFA\u2019s and of finite languages. The paper is organised as follows. In the next section, we review some basic notions and introduce some notation. Section 3 describes a string representation for deterministic finite automata that is unique up to isomorphism for initially connected deterministic finite automata. Section 4 presents an efficient method to generate those strings. Section 5 shows how their enumeration provides an upper bound and the exact value for the number of ICDFA\u2019s. Section 6 and Appendix A report some implementation issues and final remarks. 2 Preliminaries We first recall some basic notions from automata theory and formal languages, that can be found in standard books [HMU00]. An alphabet \u03a3 is a nonempty set of symbols. A string over \u03a3 is a finite sequence of symbols of \u03a3. The empty string is denoted by \u01eb. The set \u03a3 is the set of all strings over \u03a3. A language L is a subset of \u03a3. The density of a language L over \u03a3, \u03c1L(n), is the number of strings of length n that are in L, i.e., \u03c1L(n) = |L \u2229 \u03a3 |. A regular expression (r.e.) \u03b1 over \u03a3 represents a language L(\u03b1) \u2286 \u03a3 and is inductively defined by: \u2205, \u01eb and \u03c3 \u2208 \u03a3 are a r.e., where L(\u2205) = \u2205, L(\u01eb) = {\u01eb} and L(\u03c3) = {\u03c3}; if \u03b11 and \u03b12 are r.e., (\u03b11+\u03b12), (\u03b11\u03b12) and \u03b1 \u22c6 1 are r.e., respectively with L((\u03b11+\u03b12)) = L(\u03b11)\u222aL(\u03b12), L((\u03b11\u03b12)) = L(\u03b11)L(\u03b12) and L(\u03b11 ) = L(\u03b11) . In this paper, we will use regular expressions to represent descriptions of finite automata. A deterministic finite automaton (DFA) A is a quintuple (Q,\u03a3, \u03b4, q0, F ) where Q is a finite set of states, \u03a3 is the alphabet, \u03b4 : Q\u00d7 \u03a3 \u2192 Q is the transition function, q0 the initial state and F \u2286 Q the set of final states. We assume that the transition function is total, so we consider only complete DFA\u2019s. The size of a DFA 2 is the number of its states, |Q|. Normally, we are not interested in the labels of the states and we can represent them by an integer 0 \u2264 i < |Q|. The transition function \u03b4 extends naturally to \u03a3: for all q \u2208 Q, if x = \u01eb then \u03b4(q, \u01eb) = q; if x = y\u03c3 then \u03b4(q, x) = \u03b4(\u03b4(q, y), \u03c3). A DFA is initially connected1 (ICDFA) if for each state q \u2208 Q there exists a string x \u2208 \u03a3 such that \u03b4(q0, x) = q. Two DFA\u2019s A = (Q,\u03a3, \u03b4, q0, F ) and A \u2032 = (Q,\u03a3, \u03b4, q 0, F ) are called isomorphic (by states) if there exists a bijection f : Q \u2192 Q such that f(q0) = q \u2032 0 and for all \u03c3 \u2208 \u03a3 and q \u2208 Q, f(\u03b4(q, \u03c3)) = \u03b4(f(q), \u03c3). Furthermore, for all q \u2208 Q, q \u2208 F if and only if f(q) \u2208 F . The language accepted by a DFA A is L(A) = {x \u2208 \u03a3 | \u03b4(q0, x) \u2208 F}. Two DFA are equivalent if they accept the same language. Obviously, two isomorphic automata are equivalent, but two non-isomorphic automata may be equivalent. A DFA A is minimal if there is no DFA A with fewer states equivalent to A. Trivially a minimal DFA is an ICDFA. Minimal DFA\u2019s are unique up to isomorphism. We are mainly concerned with the representation of the transition function of DFA\u2019s of size n over an alphabet of k symbols , so we disregard the set of final states and we consider only a quadruple (Q,\u03a3, \u03b4, q0) called the structure of an automaton and referred as DFA\u2205. For each of our representations, there will be 2 DFA\u2019s. We denote by ICDFA\u2205 the structure of an ICDFA. We consider that any integer variable has always a nonnegative value (if not otherwise stated). Let [n]0 = {0, 1, . . . , n} and [n] = {1, . . . , n}. 3 Representations towards a normal form The method used to represent a DFA has a significative role in the amount of computer work needed to manipulate that information, and can give an important insight about this set of objects, both in its characterisation and enumeration. Let us disregard the set of final states of a DFA. A naive representation of a DFA\u2205 can be obtained by the enumeration of its states and for each state a list of its transitions for each symbol. For the DFA\u2205 in Fig.1 we have: [[A (a : A, b : B)], [B (a : A, b : E)], [C (a : B, b : E)], [D (a : D, b : C)], [E (a : A, b : E)]].

They incorporate design principles that are typically very hard to verify formally. In particular, the standard exhaustive formal verification techniques are unlikely to scale well for the complex designs that are developed in industry. Furthermore, the Stateflow language lacks a formal semantics, which additionally hinders the formal analysis. To address these challenges, we lay here the foundations of a scalable technique for provably correct formal analysis of Stateflow models, with respect to invariant properties, based on bounded model checking (BMC) over symbolic executions. The crux of our technique is: i) a representation of the state space of Stateflow models as a symbolic transition system (STS) over the symbolic configurations of the model, as the basis for BMC, and ii) application of incremental BMC, to generate verification results after each unrolling of the next-state relation of the transition system. To this end, we develop a symbolic structural operational semantics (SSOS) for Stateflow, starting from an existing structural operational semantics (SOS), and show the preservation of invariant properties between the two. Next, we define bounded invariant checking for STS over symbolic configurations as a satisfiability problem. We develop an automated procedure for generating the initial and next-state predicates of the STS, and propose an encoding scheme of the bounded invariant checking problem as a set of constraints, ready for automated analysis with standard, off-the-shelf satisfiability solvers.

Proactive libraries blend libraries with multiple proactive modules that collect data, check the correctness policies of the libraries, and heal executions as soon as the violation of a correctness policy is detected.

An automaton is called unambiguous if it has at most one accepting run on every input, the language of such an automaton is called an unambiguous language. It is known that not every regular language of infinite trees is unambiguous. Except that, very little is known about which regular tree languages are unambiguous. \nThis paper answers the question whether unambiguous languages are of bounded complexity among all regular tree languages. The notion of complexity is the canonical one, called the (parity or Rabin-Mostowski) index hierarchy. The answer is negative, as exhibited by a family of examples of unambiguous languages that cannot be recognised by any alternating parity tree automata of bounded range of priorities. \nHardness of the given examples is based on the theory of signatures in parity games, previously studied by Walukiewicz. This theory is further developed here to construct canonical signatures. The technical core of the article is a parity game that compares signatures of a given pair of parity games (without an increase in the index).", "venue": "ICALP", "authors": ["Michal  Skrzypczak"], "year": 2018, "n_citations": 2}

Therefore, we suggest a unique perspective on this central issue, to which we would like to refer as transparent connectionism, by proposing accounts of how symbolic computation can be implemented in neural substrates. In this study we first introduce a new model of dynamics on a symbolic space, the versatile shift, showing that it supports the real-time simulation of a range of automata. We then show that the G\u00f6delization of versatile shifts defines nonlinear dynamical automata, dynamical systems evolving on a vectorial space. Finally, we present a mapping between nonlinear dynamical automata and recurrent artificial neural networks. The mapping defines an architecture characterized by its granular modularity, where data, symbolic operations and their control are not only distinguishable in activation space, but also spatially localizable in the network itself, while maintaining a distributed encoding of symbolic representations. The resulting networks simulate automata in real-time and are programmed directly, in the absence of network training. To discuss the unique characteristics of the architecture and their consequences, we present two examples: (i) the design of a Central Pattern Generator from a finite-state locomotive controller, and (ii) the creation of a network simulating a system of interactive automata that supports the parsing of garden-path sentences as investigated in psycholinguistics experiments.", "venue": "Neural Networks", "authors": ["Giovanni S.

Our contribution to solve this long-standing problem which relates, for instance, to the reachability analysis of recursive programs over unbounded data domain, is to identify a class of CFLs called the finiteindex CFLs for which the problem is decidable. The k-index approximation of a CFL can be obtained by discarding all the words that cannot be derived within a budget k on the number of occurrences of non-terminals. A finite-index CFL is thus a CFL which coincides with its k-index approximation for some k. We decide whether the intersection of a finite-index CFL and a PNL is empty by reducing it to the reachability problem of Petri nets with weak inhibitor arcs, a class of systems with infinitely many states for which reachability is known to be decidable.

Traditionally, reactive synthesis has been applied to the construction of a stateful hardware circuit. This work is motivated by applications to other domains, such as the IoT (the Internet of Things) and robotics, where it is necessary to coordinate the actions of multiple sensors, devices, and robots. The mathematical model represents such entities as individual processes in Hoare's CSP model. Given a network of interacting entities, called an \\emph{environment}, and a temporal specification of long-term behavior, the synthesis method constructs a \\emph{coordinator} process (if one exists) that guides the actions of the environment entities so that the combined system is deadlock-free and satisfies the given specification. The main technical challenge is that a coordinator may have only \\emph{partial knowledge} of the environment state, due to non-determinism within the environment, and environment actions that are hidden from the coordinator. This is the first method to handle both sources of partial knowledge, and to do so for arbitrary linear temporal logic specifications.

But how can the dependencies of the deforming impact of a transformation of the box, such as 'do not tilt the box over when the lid is open' or 'open the lid again each time it gets closed' be modeled? We present three attempts to model constraints of these kinds on the order in which the states of an automaton are transitioned by a synchronizing word. The first two concepts relate the last visits of states and form constraints on which states still need to be reached, whereas the third concept concerns the first visits of states and forms constraints on which states might still be reached. We examine the computational complexity of different variants of the problem, whether an automaton can be synchronized with a word that respects the constraints defined in the respective concept, and obtain nearly a full classification. While most of the problems are PSPACE-complete we also observe NP-complete variants and variants solvable in polynomial time. We will also observe a drop of the complexity if we track the orders of states on several paths simultaneously instead of tracking the set of active states.

We aim to shed light on our understanding of global patterns that occur on infinite strings. We utilise methods of geometric group theory. Our emphasis is on large scale geometries. Two infinite strings have the same large scale geometry if there are colour preserving bi-Lipschitz maps with distortions between the strings. Call these maps quasi-isometries. Introduction of large scale geometries poses several questions. The first question asks to study the partial order induced by quasi-isometries. This partial order compares large scale geometries; as such it presents an algebraic tool for classification of global patterns. We prove there is a greatest large scale geometry and infinitely many minimal large scale geometries. The second question is related to understanding the quasi-isometric maps on various classes of strings. The third question investigates the sets of large scale geometries of strings accepted by computational models, e.g. B\u00fcchi automata. We provide an algorithm that describes large scale geometries of strings accepted by B\u00fcchi automata. This links large scale geometries with automata theory. The fourth question studies the complexity of the quasi-isometry problem. We show the problem is \u03a330-complete thus providing a bridge with computability theory. Finally, the fifth question asks to build algebraic structures that are invariants of large scale geometries.

One of the challenges for defining emergence is that the dependency on the observer's previous knowledge may cause a phenomenon to present itself as emergent for one observer at the same time that reducible for another observer. Thus, in order to quantify emergence of algorithmic information in computable generative processes, perturbation analyses may inherit such a problem of the dependency on the observer's previous formal knowledge. In this sense, by formalizing the act of observing as mutual perturbations, the emergence of algorithmic information becomes invariant, minimal, and robust to information costs and distortions, while it indeed depends on the observer. Then, we demonstrate that the unbounded increase of emergent algorithmic information implies asymptotically observer-independent emergence, which eventually overcomes any formal theory that any observer might devise. In addition, we discuss weak and strong emergence and analyze the concepts of observer-dependent emergence and asymptotically observer-independent emergence found in previous definitions and models in the literature of deterministic dynamical and computable systems.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Felipe S.

Thus, any computational architecture needs to show how it could relate to Turing machines and how stable implementations of Turing computation are possible. In this chapter, we implement universal Turing computation in a neural field environment. To this end, we employ the canonical symbologram representation of a Turing machine obtained from a Godel encoding of its symbolic repertoire and generalized shifts. The resulting nonlinear dynamical automaton (NDA) is a piecewise affine-linear map acting on the unit square that is partitioned into rectangular domains. Instead of looking at point dynamics in phase space, we then consider functional dynamics of probability distribution functions (p.d.f.s) over phase space. This is generally described by a Frobenius-Perron integral transformation that can be regarded as a neural field equation over the unit square as feature space of a Dynamic Field Theory (DFT). Solving the Frobenius-Perron equation yields that uniform p.d.f.s with rectangular support are mapped onto uniform p.d.f.s with rectangular support, again.

First, we show a reduction: the length of a regular expression for a language L \u2286 {0, 1}n is bounded from below by the minimum size of a monotone arithmetic formula computing a polynomial that has L as its set of exponent vectors, viewing words as vectors. This result yields lower bounds for the binomial language of all words with exactly k ones and n\u2212k zeros and for the language of all Dyck words of length 2n. We also determine the blow-up of language operations (intersection and shuffle) of regular expressions for finite languages.

With this method we show almost tight lower bounds for the language of all binary numbers with n bits that are divisible by a given odd integer p, for the language of all words of length n over a k letter alphabet with an even number of occurrences of each letter and for the language of all permutations of {1, . . . , n}.", "venue": "DCFS", "authors": ["Ehud  Cseresnyes", "Hannes  Seiwert"], "year": 2020, "n_citations": 2}

The subsequence automaton of S (often called the directed acyclic subsequence graph ) is the minimal deterministic finite automaton accepting all subsequences of S . A straightforward construction shows that the size (number of states and transitions) of the subsequence automaton is O ( n \u03c3 ) and that this bound is asymptotically optimal. In this paper, we consider subsequence automata with default transitions , that is, special transitions to be taken only if none of the regular transitions match the current character, and which do not consume the current character. We show that with default transitions, much smaller subsequence automata are possible, and provide a full trade-off between the size of the automaton and the delay , i.e., the maximum number of consecutive default transitions followed before consuming a character. Specifically, given any integer parameter k , 1 k \u2264 \u03c3 , we present a subsequence automaton with default transitions of size O ( n k log k \u2061 \u03c3 ) and delay O ( log k \u2061 \u03c3 ) . Hence, with k = 2 we obtain an automaton of size O ( n log \u2061 \u03c3 ) and delay O ( log \u2061 \u03c3 ) . At the other extreme, with k = \u03c3 , we obtain an automaton of size O ( n \u03c3 ) and delay O ( 1 ) , thus matching the bound for the standard subsequence automaton construction. Finally, we generalize the result to multiple strings. The key component of our result is a novel hierarchical automata construction of independent interest.", "venue": "J.

Desired motion specifications are formulated as signal temporal logic (STL), whereas the communication QoS to be optimized is captured by spatial temporal reach and escape logic (STREL) formulas. Both the STL and STREL specifications are encoded as mixed integer linear constraints posed on the system and environment state variables of the mobile robot network, where satisfactory control strategies can be computed by exploiting a distributed model predictive control (MPC) approach.

The $G_2$ conjecture states that a nondeterministic parity automaton A is GFG if and only if a token game, known as the $G_2$ game, played on A is won by the first player. So far, it had only been proved for Buchi automata; we provide further evidence for it by proving it for coBuchi automata.

RNAFeatures* acts on formal, arc-labeled RNA secondary structures, called \u03bb-structures. \u03bb-structures correspond one-to-one to pk-structures together with some additional information. This information consists of the specific rearrangement of the backbone, by which a pk-structure can be made cross-free.

In this style, instead of waiting for time-consuming operations to complete, the programmer makes a non-blocking call to the operation and posts a callback task to a task buffer that is executed later when the time-consuming operation completes. A cooperative scheduler mediates the interaction by picking and executing callback tasks from the task buffer to completion (and these callbacks can post further callbacks to be executed later). Writing correct asynchronous programs is hard because the use of callbacks, while efficient, obscures program control flow.\n We provide a formal model underlying asynchronous programs and study verification problems for this model. We show that the safety verification problem for finite-data asynchronous programs is expspace-complete. We show that liveness verification for finite-data asynchronous programs is decidable and polynomial-time equivalent to Petri net reachability. Decidability is not obvious, since even if the data is finite-state, asynchronous programs constitute infinite-state transition systems: both the program stack for an executing task and the task buffer of pending calls to tasks can be potentially unbounded.\n Our main technical constructions are polynomial-time, semantics-preserving reductions from asynchronous programs to Petri nets and back. The first reduction allows the use of algorithmic techniques on Petri nets for the verification of asynchronous programs, and the second allows lower bounds on Petri nets to apply also to asynchronous programs.\n We also study several extensions to the basic models of asynchronous programs that are inspired by additional capabilities provided by implementations of asynchronous libraries and classify the decidability and undecidability of verification questions on these extensions.", "venue": "TOPL", "authors": ["Pierre  Ganty", "Rupak  Majumdar"], "year": 2012, "n_citations": 91}

More precisely, the weight in the i-th position of the run is divided by $\\lambda^i$, where the discount factor $\\lambda$ is a fixed rational number greater than 1. The value of a word is the minimal value of the automaton runs on it. Discounted summation is a common and useful measuring scheme, especially for infinite sequences, reflecting the assumption that earlier weights are more important than later weights. Unfortunately, determinization of NDAs, which is often essential in formal verification, is, in general, not possible. We provide positive news, showing that every NDA with an integral discount factor is determinizable. We complete the picture by proving that the integers characterize exactly the discount factors that guarantee determinizability: for every nonintegral rational discount factor $\\lambda$, there is a nondeterminizable $\\lambda$-NDA. We also prove that the class of NDAs with integral discount factors enjoys closure under the algebraic operations min, max, addition, and subtraction, which is not the case for general NDAs nor for deterministic NDAs. For general NDAs, we look into approximate determinization, which is always possible as the influence of a word's suffix decays. We show that the naive approach, of unfolding the automaton computations up to a sufficient level, is doubly exponential in the discount factor. We provide an alternative construction for approximate determinization, which is singly exponential in the discount factor, in the precision, and in the number of states. We also prove matching lower bounds, showing that the exponential dependency on each of these three parameters cannot be avoided.

In our framework, the number of agents or the amount of certain resources are parameterized (i.e. not known a priori), and the corresponding verification problem asks whether a given epistemic property is true regardless of the instantiation of the parameters. For example, in a muddy children puzzle, one could ask whether each child will eventually find out whether (s)he is muddy, regardless of the number of children. Our framework is regular model checking (RMC) -based, wherein synchronous finite-state automata (equivalently, monadic secondorder logic over words) are used to specify the systems.

Of special interests is the addition of the so-called iterated public announcement operators, which are crucial for reasoning about knowledge in parameterized systems.

Recent results show multiple advantages of using deterministic automata in symbolic and bounded model checking of LTL safety properties.

The varieties of idempotent monoids are very well understood and fully classified. Trotter and Weil showed that for every band variety V there exists a unique maximal variety W inside DA such that the intersection with bands yields the given band variety V.

The aim of the attacker is that of altering the state estimation of the operator. An automaton, called attack structure, is defined to describe the set of all possible attacks. In more details, an unbounded attack structure is obtained by concurrent composition of two state observers, the attacker observer and the operator observer. The attack structure shows, for each possible corrupted observation, the joint state estimation, i.e., the set of states consistent with the uncorrupted observation and the set of states consistent with the corrupted observation. Such a structure can be used to establish if an attack function is harmful w.r.t. a misleading relation. Our approach is also extended to the case in which the attacker may insert at most n events between two consecutive", "venue": "IEEE Access", "authors": ["Qi  Zhang", "Carla  Seatzu", "Zhiwu  Li", "Alessandro  Giua"], "year": 2021, "n_citations": 0}

Nested pushdown trees are useful representations of control flows in the verification of programs with recursive calls of first-order functions. Higher-order nested pushdown trees are expansions of unfoldings of graphs generated by higher-order pushdown systems. Moreover, the class of nested pushdown trees of level n is uniformly first-order interpretable in the class of collapsible pushdown graphs of level n\u2009+\u20091. The relationship between the class of higher-order pushdown graphs and the class of collapsible higher-order pushdown graphs is not very well understood. We hope that the further study of the nested pushdown tree hierarchy leads to a better understanding of these two hierarchies. In this article, we are concerned with the first-order model checking problem on higher-order nested pushdown trees. We show that the first-order model checking on the first two levels of this hierarchy is decidable. Moreover, we obtain an alternating 2-EXPTIME algorithm for the class of nested pushdown trees of level 1. The proof technique involves a pseudo-local analysis of strategies in the Ehrenfeucht-Fra\u00efss\u00e9 games on two identical copies of a nested pushdown tree. Ordinary locality arguments in the spirit of Gaifman\u2019s lemma do not apply here because nested pushdown trees tend to have small diameters. We introduce the notion of relevant ancestors which provide a sufficient description of the FOk-type of each element in a higher-order nested pushdown tree. The local analysis of these ancestors allows us to prove the existence of restricted winning strategies in the Ehrenfeucht-Fra\u00efss\u00e9 game.

In general, there exist many diverse counterexamples that exhibit distinct violating behaviors, which the user may wish to examine before deciding how to repair the model. Unfortunately, obtaining this information is challenging in existing model checkers since (1) the number of counterexamples may be too large to enumerate one by one, and (2) many of these counterexamples are redundant, in that they describe the same type of violating behavior. In this paper, we propose a technique called counterexample classification. The goal of classification is to partition the space of all counterexamples into a finite set of counterexample classes, each of which describes a distinct type of violating behavior for the given specification. These classes are then presented as a summary of possible violating behaviors in the system, freeing the user from manually having to inspect or analyze numerous counterexamples to extract the same information.

A strengthened substitution-based proof technique is used for reduction validation, while a fixed template of candidate counter examples is used for reduction refutation; put together, they constitute our (partial) solution to the reduction verification problem.

They showed that some NP-complete properties such as Hamiltonicity can be decided in polynomial time on digraphs of constant directed treewidth. Nevertheless, despite more than one decade of intensive research, the list of hard combinatorial problems that are known to be solvable in polynomial time when restricted to digraphs of constant directed treewidth has remained scarce. In this work we enrich this list by providing for the first time an algorithmic metatheorem connecting the monadic second order logic of graphs to directed treewidth. We show that most of the known positive algorithmic results for digraphs of constant directed treewidth can be reformulated in terms of our metatheorem. Additionally, we show how to use our metatheorem to provide polynomial time algorithms for two classes of combinatorial problems that have not yet been studied in the context of directed width measures. More precisely, for each fixed $k,w \\in \\mathbb{N}$, we show how to count in polynomial time on digraphs of directed treewidth $w$, the number of minimum spanning strong subgraphs that are the union of $k$ directed paths, and the number of maximal subgraphs that are the union of $k$ directed paths and satisfy a given minor closed property. To prove our metatheorem we devise two technical tools which we believe to be of independent interest. First, we introduce the notion of tree-zig-zag number of a digraph, a new directed width measure that is at most a constant times directed treewidth. Second, we introduce the notion of $z$-saturated tree slice language, a new formalism for the specification and manipulation of infinite sets of digraphs.", "venue": "Discret. Appl.

VLSAT-31 is a collection of 1200 SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories) formulas (i.e., first-order logic formulas), written in six different quantifier-free logic fragments. For each of these logic fragments, 100 satisfiable and 100 unsatisfiable formulas are provided, which results in 12 families containing 100 benchmarks each. Each formula is provided as a separate file, encoded in the SMT-LIB 2.6 format [1]. Each file is then compressed using bzip2 to save disk space and allow faster downloads. The 1200 formulas require 2.4 gigabytes of disk space and 132 megabytes when compressed using bzip2. The VLSAT-3 benchmarks are licensed under the CC-BY Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License2. 2 Scientific Context Interesting SMT formulas can be generated as a by-product of our recent work [4] on the decomposition of Petri nets into networks of automata, a problem that has been around since the early 70s. Concretely, we developed a tool chain that takes as input a Petri net (which must be ordinary, safe, and hopefully not too large) and produces as output a network of automata that execute concurrently and synchronize using shared transitions. Precisely, this network is expressed as a Nested-Unit Petri Net (NUPN) [5], i.e., an extension of a Petri net, in which places are grouped into sets (called units) that denote sequential components. A NUPN provides a proper structuring of its underlying Petri net, and enables formal verification tools to be more efficient in terms of memory and CPU time. Hence, the NUPN concept has been implemented in many tools and adopted by software competitions, such as the Model Checking Contest3 [9, 8] and the Rigorous Examination of Reactive Systems challenge4 [6, 10, 7]. Each NUPN generated by our tool chain is flat, meaning that its units are not recursively nested in each other, and unit-safe, meaning that each unit has at most one execution token at a time. Our tool chain works by reformulating concurrency constraints on Petri nets as logical problems, which can be later solved using third-party software, such as SAT solvers, SMT solvers, and tools for graph coloring and finding maximum cliques, depending on the chosen strategy [4]. When a strategy involving SMT solving is selected, the tool chain produces formulas to be processed by SMT solvers. The tool chain is solver-agnostic and supports six standard SMT logic fragments. 3 Structure of Formulas Each of our formulas was produced for a particular Petri net. A formula depends on four factors: \u2022 the set P of the places of the Petri net; \u2022 a concurrency relation \u2016 defined over P , such that p \u2016 p\u2032 iff both places p and p\u2032 may simultaneously have an execution token; 1https://cadp.inria.fr/resources/vlsat/3.html 2License terms available from http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0 3https://mcc.lip6.fr 4http://rers-challenge.org", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Pierre  Bouvier"], "year": 2021, "n_citations": 0}

Though various measures have been proposed, it was recently demonstrated that they neither fulfil essential properties, such as monotonicity, nor can they handle infinite behaviour.

The approach uses, for a given picture language L and an integer m > 0 the height-m fragment of L, which is defined as the word language obtained by considering each picture p of height m in L as a word, where the letters of that word are the columns of p. A key idea is to measure the complexity of a regular word language by the group complexity of its syntactic monoid. Given a picture language L, such a word language measure may be applied to each of its height fragments, so that the complexity of the picture language is a function that maps each m to the complexity of the height-m fragment of L. The asymptotic growth rate of that function may be bounded based on the structure of a monadic second-order formula that defines L.

Regular expression matching is an ubiquitous problem in computer science, finding fundamental applications in areas including, but not limited to, natural language processing, search engines, compilers, and databases. Recent results have settled the exact complexity of this problem: \u0398(\u03c0m) time is necessary and sufficient for indexed pattern matching queries, where m is the size of an NFA recognizing L. This, however, does not mean that all regular languages are hard to index: for instance, for the sub-class of Wheeler languages [SODA\u201920] we can reduce query time to the optimal O(\u03c0). A Wheeler language admits a total order of a finite refinement of its Myhill-Nerode equivalence classes reflecting the co-lexicographic order of their elements. This boosts indexing performance because classes whose elements are suffixed by P form a range in this order. In [SODA\u201921], this technique was extended to arbitrary NFAs by allowing the order to be partial. This line of attack suggested that the width p of such an order is the parameter ultimately capturing the fine-grained complexity of the problem: (i) indexed pattern matching can always be solved in O(\u03c0p2) time, (ii) the standard powerset construction algorithm always produces an output whose size is exponential in p rather than in the input\u2019s size, and (iii) p even determines how succinctly NFAs can be encoded. In the present work, we take a step further and study the hierarchy of p-sortable languages: regular languages accepted by automata of width p. Our main contributions are the following: (i) we show that the hierarchy is strict and does not collapse, (ii) we provide (exponential) upper and lower bounds relating the minimum widths of equivalent NFAs and DFAs, and (iii) we characterize DFAs of minimum p for a given L via a co-lexicographic variant of the Myhill-Nerode theorem. Our findings imply that in polynomial time we can build an index breaking the worst-case conditional lower bound of \u03a9(\u03c0m), whenever the input NFA\u2019s width is at most \u03b5 log2 m, for any constant 0 \u2264 \u03b5 < 1/2. 2012 ACM Subject Classification Theory of computation \u2192 Pattern matching", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Nicola  Cotumaccio", "Giovanna  D'Agostino", "Alberto  Policriti", "Nicola  Prezza"], "year": 2021, "n_citations": 1}

This work is a contribution to the study of the set of the representations of integers. This prefix-closed subset of the free monoid is naturally represented as a highly non-regular tree. Its nodes are the integers, its edges bear labels taken in {0,1,...,p-1}, and its subtrees are all distinct. \nWe associate with each subtree (or with its root n) three infinite words. The bottom word of n is the lexicographically smallest word that is the label of a branch of the subtree. The top word of n is defined similarly. The span-word of n is the digitwise difference between the latter and the former. \nFirst, we show that the set of all the span-words is accepted by an infinite automaton whose underlying graph is essentially the same as the tree itself. Second, we study the function that computes for all n the bottom word associated with n+1 from the one associated with n, and show that it is realised by an infinite sequential transducer whose underlying graph is once again essentially the same as the tree itself. \nAn infinite word may be interpreted as an expansion in base p/q after the radix point, hence evaluated to a real number. If T is a subtree whose root is n, then the evaluations of the labels of the branches of T form an interval of $\\mathbb{R}$. The length of this interval is called the span of n and is equal to the evaluation of the span-word of n. The set of all spans is then a subset of R and we use the preceding construction to study its topological closure.

For safety-critical systems such as autonomous vehicles, it can be problematic to use controllers learned from data because they cannot be guaranteed to be collision-free. Recently, a method has been proposed for learning a multi-mode hybrid automaton cruise controller (MOHA). Besides being accurate, the logical nature of this model makes it suitable for formal verification. In this paper, we demonstrate this capability using the SpaceEx hybrid model checker as follows. After learning, we translate the automaton model into constraints and equations required by SpaceEx. We then verify that a pure MOHA controller is not collision-free. By adding a safety state based on headway in time, a rule that human drivers should follow anyway, we do obtain a provably safe cruise control.

The synthesis problem then asks whether there is a finite number of processes for which the system can satisfy the specification. This variant is already undecidable for very limited logics.

While the two notions coincide for standard reachability goals, they diverge for temporally extended goals.

The observer would then like to decide if it is possible to bring the automaton from any state into some predetermined state by giving inputs to it in an adaptive manner, i.e., the next input letter to be given can depend on how the contents of the stack changed after the current input letter. We show that for non-deterministic pushdown automata, this problem is 2-EXPTIME-complete and for deterministic pushdown automata, we show EXPTIME-completeness. To prove the lower bounds, we first introduce (different variants of) subset-synchronisation and show that these problems are polynomial-time equivalent with the adaptive synchronisation problem. We then prove hardness results for the subset-synchronisation problems.

In order to capture the expressiveness of most modal temporal logics encountered in the literature, we introduce weakly cyclic Terminological Boxes (TBoxes) of MTALC(Dx), whose axioms capture the decreasing property of modal temporal operators. We show the important result that satisfiability of an MTALC(Dx) concept with respect to a weakly cyclic TBox can be reduced to the emptiness problem of a Buchi weak alternating automaton augmented with spatial constraints.

The tool we have developed unifies almost all of the work done in behavioral programming so far, under a common set of interfaces. Its architecture supports pluggable event selection strategies, which can make models more intuitive and compact. Program state space can be traversed using various algorithms, such as DFS and A*. Furthermore, program state is represented in a way that enables scanning a state space using parallel and distributed algorithms. Executable models created with this tool can be directly embedded in Java applications, enabling a model-first approach to system engineering, where initially a model is created and verified, and then a working application is gradually built around the model. The model itself consists of a collection of small scripts written in JavaScript (hence \"BPjs\"). Using a variety of case-studies, this paper shows how the combination of a lenient programming language with formal model analysis tools creates an efficient way of developing robust complex systems. Additionally, as we learned from an experimental course we ran, the usage of JavaScript make practitioners more amenable to using this system and, thus, model checking and model driven engineering. In addition to providing infrastructure for development and case-studies in behavioral programming, the tool is designed to serve as a common platform for research and innovation in behavioral programming and in model driven engineering in general.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Michael  Bar-Sinai", "Gera  Weiss", "Reut  Shmuel"], "year": 2018, "n_citations": 2}

Being guided by predicates is not just beneficial in dealing with syntactic dissimilarities, but also in staying relevant to the property. However, there are also drawbacks of a trace-based technique. Obtaining traces that cover all program behaviors is difficult, and any under-approximation may lead to an incomplete product program.

However, no single tool has emerged as the dominant solution for system design. Each tool differs from the others in terms of the modeling language used, its verification capabilities and other complementary features, and each development context has peculiar needs that require different tools. This is particularly problematic for the railway industry, in which formal methods are highly recommended by the norms, but no actual guidance is provided for the selection of tools. To guide companies in the selection of the most appropriate formal tools to adopt in their contexts, a clear assessment of the features of the currently available tools is required. To address this goal, this paper considers a set of 13 formal tools that have been used for railway system design, and it presents a systematic evaluation of such tools and a preliminary usability analysis of a subset of 7 tools, involving railway practitioners. The results are discussed considering the most desired aspects by industry and earlier related studies. While the focus is on the railway domain, the overall methodology can be applied to similar contexts. Our study thus contributes with a systematic evaluation of formal tools and it shows that despite the poor graphical interfaces, usability and maturity of the tools are not major problems, as claimed by contributions from the literature.

However, this verification is facing severe challenges. First, in realistic settings, the computing entities only have imperfectly synchronized clocks.

Second, the specification should be able to express properties with real-time constraints despite the asynchrony, and the semantics should be interpreted over the currently-observed and continuously-growing trace. To address these challenges, we propose PARO - the partially synchronous system observation framework, which i) adopts the partially synchronous model of time, and introduces the lattice and the timed automata theories to model the trace of system execution; ii) adopts a tailored subset of TCTL to specify temporal properties, and defines the 3-valued semantics to interpret the properties over the currently-observed finite trace; iii) constructs the timed automaton corresponding to the trace at runtime, and reduces the satisfaction of the 3-valued semantics over finite traces to that of the classical boolean semantics over infinite traces.

This field has been traditionally approached from a practical point of view, resulting in heterogeneous implementations with fundamentally different capabilities. The main reason behind this is that defining formal semantics for a CER language is not trivial: they usually combine first-order variables for joining and filtering events with regular operators like sequencing and Kleene closure. Moreover, their semantics usually focus only on the detection of complex events, leaving the concept of output mostly unattended. \nIn this paper, we propose to unify the semantics and output of complex event recognition languages by using second order objects. Specifically, we introduce a CER language called Second Order Complex Event Logic (SO-CEL for short), that uses second order variables for managing and outputting sequences of events. This makes the definition of the main CER operators simple, allowing us to develop the first steps in understanding its expressive power. We start by comparing SO-CEL with a version that uses first-order variables called FO-CEL, showing that they are equivalent in expressive power when restricted to unary predicates but, surprisingly, incomparable in general. Nevertheless, we show that if we restrict to sets of binary predicates, then SO-CEL is strictly more expressive than FO-CEL. Then, we introduce a natural computational model called Unary Complex Event Automata (UCEA) that provides a better understanding of SO-CEL. We show that, under unary predicates, SO-CEL captures the subclass of UCEA that satisfy the so-called *-property. Finally, we identify the operations that SO-CEL is lacking to capture UCEA and introduce a natural extension of the language that captures the complete class of UCEA under unary predicates.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Alejandro  Grez", "Cristian  Riveros", "Mart\u00edn  Ugarte", "Stijn  Vansummeren"], "year": 2017, "n_citations": 2}

In computability theory the notion of encoding is crucial for defining computability on arbitrary domains, as well as for comparing the power of models of computation. In language theory much attention has been devoted to regularity preserving functions. A natural question arising in these contexts is: Is there a bijective encoding such that its image function preserves regularity of languages, but its pre-image function does not? Our main result answers this question in the affirmative: For every countable class C of languages there exists a bijective encoding f such that for every language L \u2208 L its image f[L] is regular. Our construction of such encodings has several noteworthy consequences. Firstly, anomalies arise when models of computation are compared with respect to a known concept of implementation that is based on encodings which are not required to be computable: Every countable decision model can be implemented, in this sense, by finite-state automata, even via bijective encodings. Hence deterministic finite-state automata would be equally powerful as Turing machine deciders. A second consequence concerns the recognizability of sets of natural numbers via number representations and finite automata. A set of numbers is said to be recognizable with respect to a representation if an automaton accepts the language of representations.

In arXiv:1102.2960 we showed a construction for complementing Streett automata with the upper bound $2^{O(n \\lg n+nk \\lg k)}$ for $k = O(n)$ and $2^{O(n^{2} \\lg n)}$ for $k=\\omega(n)$. In this paper we establish a matching lower bound $2^{\\Omega(n \\lg n+nk \\lg k)}$ for $k = O(n)$ and $2^{\\Omega(n^{2} \\lg n)}$ for $k = \\omega(n)$, and therefore showing that the construction is asymptotically optimal with respect to the $2^{\\Theta(\\cdot)}$ notation.", "venue": "FSTTCS", "authors": ["Yang  Cai", "Ting  Zhang"], "year": 2011, "n_citations": 10}

Specifically, this paper demonstrates that the family of languages generated by semi-conditional grammars of degree (1,1) coincides with the family of random context languages.

The proposed model is then formally validated: more precisely, we ensure that some relevant properties expressed as temporal logical formulae hold in the model. Once the validation step is accomplished, we take advantage of the proposed model to write an algorithm for learning synaptical weight values such that an expected behavior can be displayed.

Our definition of regularity relies on the theory of string-to-tree transducers, and allows associating costs with events that are conditional upon regular properties of future events.

To address reversibility of finite CAs, we develop a mathematical tool, named reachability tree, which can efficiently characterize those CAs. A decision algorithm is proposed using minimized reachability tree which takes a CA rule and size n as input and verifies whether the CA is reversible for that n. To decide reversibility of a finite CA, we need to know both the rule and the CA size. However, for infinite CAs, reversibility is decided based on the local rule only. Therefore, apparently, these two cases seem to be divergent. This dissertation targets to construct a bridge between these two cases. To do so, reversibility of CAs is redefined and the notion of semi-reversible CAs is introduced. Hence, we propose a new classification of finite CAs -(1) reversible CAs, (2) semi-reversible CAs and (3) strictly irreversible CAs. Finally, relation between reversibility of finite and infinite CAs is established. This dissertation also explores CAs as source of randomness and build pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) based on CAs. We identify a list of properties for a CA to be a good source of randomness. Two heuristic algorithms are proposed to synthesize candidate (decimal) CAs which have great potentiality as PRNGs. Two schemes tare developed o use these CAs as window-based PRNGs - (1) as decimal number generators and as (2) binary number generators. We empirically observe that in comparison to the best PRNG SFMT19937-64, average performance of our proposed PRNGs are slightly better.

The challenge is to alleviate the size explosion of the search space when considering networks of timed automata working in parallel.

Salah et al. in 2006 have shown that the union of all these different zones is also a zone. This observation was used in an algorithm which from time to time detects and aggregates these zones into a single zone. \nWe show that such aggregated zones can be calculated more efficiently using the local time semantics and the related notion of local zones proposed by Bengtsson et al. in 1998. Next, we point out a flaw in the existing method to ensure termination of the local zone graph computation. We fix this with a new algorithm that builds the local zone graph and uses abstraction techniques over (standard) zones for termination. We evaluate our algorithm on standard examples.

We say that \u03b1 matches a word w, consisting only of terminal letters, if w can be obtained by replacing the variables of \u03b1 by terminal words. The matching problem, i.e., deciding whether a given pattern matches a given word, was heavily investigated: it is NP-complete in general, but can be solved efficiently for classes of patterns with restricted structure. In this paper, we approach this problem in a generalized setting, by considering approximate pattern matching under Hamming distance. More precisely, we are interested in what is the minimum Hamming distance between w and any word u obtained by replacing the variables of \u03b1 by terminal words. Firstly, we address the class of regular patterns (in which no variable occurs twice) and propose efficient algorithms for this problem, as well as matching conditional lower bounds. We show that the problem can still be solved efficiently if we allow repeated variables, but restrict the way the different variables can be interleaved according to a locality parameter. However, as soon as we allow a variable to occur more than once and its occurrences can be interleaved arbitrarily with those of other variables, even if none of them occurs more than once, the problem becomes intractable. 2012 ACM Subject Classification Theory of computation \u2192 Design and analysis of algorithms; Theory of computation \u2192 Formal languages and automata theory", "venue": "MFCS", "authors": ["Pawel  Gawrychowski", "Florin  Manea", "Stefan  Siemer"], "year": 2021, "n_citations": 0}

A transition changes the current state to the next state, and every counter is either incremented, or decremented, or left unchanged. A state and value for each counter is a configuration; and a computation is an infinite sequence of configurations with transitions between successive configurations. A probabilistic VASS consists of a VASS along with a probability distribution over the transitions for each state. Qualitative properties such as state and configuration reachability have been widely studied for VASS. In this work we consider multi-dimensional long-run average objectives for VASS and probabilistic VASS. For a counter, the cost of a configuration is the value of the counter; and the long-run average value of a computation for the counter is the long-run average of the costs of the configurations in the computation. The multi-dimensional long-run average problem given a VASS and a threshold value for each counter, asks whether there is a computation such that for each counter the long-run average value for the counter does not exceed the respective threshold. For probabilistic VASS, instead of the existence of a computation, we consider whether the expected long-run average value for each counter does not exceed the respective threshold. Our main results are as follows: we show that the multi-dimensional long-run average problem (a) is NP-complete for integer-valued VASS; (b) is undecidable for natural-valued VASS (i.e., nonnegative counters); and (c) can be solved in polynomial time for probabilistic integer-valued VASS, and probabilistic natural-valued VASS when all computations are non-terminating.", "venue": "CONCUR", "authors": ["Krishnendu  Chatterjee", "Thomas A.

It is central in data compression, as well as in efficient query algorithms for sequence data, such as webpages, genomic and other biological sequences, or indeed any textual data. The BWT lends itself well to compression because its number of equal-letter-runs (usually referred to as $r$) is often considerably lower than that of the original string; in particular, it is well suited for strings with many repeated factors. In fact, much attention has been paid to the $r$ parameter as measure of repetitiveness, especially to evaluate the performance in terms of both space and time of compressed indexing data structures. \nIn this paper, we investigate $\\rho(v)$, the ratio of $r$ and of the number of runs of the BWT of the reverse of $v$.

The maximum number of ordinary squares in a word is known to be asymptotically linear, but the exact bound is still investigated. We present several results on the maximum number of distinct squares for nonstandard factor equivalence relations. Let SQ Abel ( n , \u017a ) and SQ Abel ' ( n , \u017a ) denote the maximum number of Abelian squares in a word of length n over an alphabet of size \u017a which are distinct as words and which are nonequivalent in the Abelian sense, respectively.

Such properties address aspects such as costs and rewards, quality measures, resource consumption, distance metrics, etc. \nExisting solutions for problems in quantitative analysis face two challenges, namely lack of generalizability and separation-of-techniques. Lack of generalizability refers to the issue that solution approaches are specialized to cost model. Different cost models deploy such disparate algorithms that there is no transfer of knowledge from one cost model to another. Separation-of-techniques refers to the inherent dichotomy in solving problems in quantitative analysis. Most algorithms comprise of a structural phase which reasons about the structure of the quantitative system(s) using techniques from automata or graphs, and a numerical phase, which reasons about the quantitative dimension/cost model using numerical methods. The techniques used in both phases are so unlike each other that they are difficult to combine, thereby impacting scalability. \nThis thesis contributes to a novel framework that addresses these challenges. The introduced framework, called comparator automata or comparators in short, builds on automata-theoretic foundations to generalize across a variety of cost models. Comparators enable automata-based methods in the numerical phase, hence eradicating the dependence on numerical methods. In doing so, comparators are able to integrate the structural and numerical phases. On the theoretical front, we demonstrate that these have the advantage of generalizable results, and yield complexity-theoretic improvements over a range of problems in quantitative analysis.

Using key examples of complex reaction networks from carbohydrate chemistry we demonstrate the feasibility of this high-level strategy framework. While being designed for chemical applications, the framework can also be used to emulate higher-level transformation models such as illustrated in a small puzzle game.", "venue": "Int. J. Comput.

The importance measures are then in turn used to obtain a criticality value for each system component and to rank the components in descending manner. Simulations tools are generally used to perform importance measure based analysis, but they require expensive computations and thus they are not suitable for large systems. A more scalable approach is to utilize the importance measures to obtain all the necessary conditions by proving a generic relationship describing the relative importance between any pair of components in a system. In this paper, we propose to use higher-order-logic (HOL) theorem proving to verify such relationships and thus making sure that all the essential conditions are accompanied by the proven property.

We give algorithms to compute the strategies of Eve that ensure minimal regret against an adversary whose choice of strategy is (i) unrestricted, (ii) limited to positional strategies, or (iii) limited to word strategies, and show that the two last cases have natural modelling applications.

The framework is equivalent to PDA where also deterministic (i.e. alternative-free) epsilon-steps are allowed, hence to the model for which Senizergues showed an involved procedure deciding bisimilarity (1998, 2005).

Since a UAV may fail or be compromised, it is important to provide necessary resilience to such contingencies, thus ensuring data security. It is important to provide the UAVs with efficient spatio-temporal trajectories so that they can efficiently cover necessary data sources. In this work, we present Synth4UAV, a formal approach for automated synthesis of efficient trajectories for a UAV swarm by logically modeling the aerial space and data point topology, UAV moves, and associated constraints in terms of the turning and climbing angle, fuel usage, data collection point coverage, data freshness, and resiliency properties.

The solution to the model provides the routing and maneuvering plan for each UAV, including the time to visit the points on the paths and corresponding fuel usage such that the necessary data points are visited while satisfying the resiliency requirements.

We show that the problem is in O(log log |w|) for languages in an algebraically-defined, decidable class QSG, and that it is in O(1) for another such class QLZG.

The first algorithm operates in two passes in a semi-streaming fashion, using a constant amount of working memory and an auxiliary tape storage which is written in the first pass and consumed by the second. The second algorithm is a single-pass and optimally streaming algorithm which outputs as much of the parse tree as is semantically possible based on the input prefix read so far, and resorts to buffering as many symbols as is required to resolve the next choice. Optimality is obtained by performing a PSPACE-complete pre-analysis on the regular expression. \nIn the second part we present Kleenex, a language for expressing high-performance streaming string processing programs as regular grammars with embedded semantic actions, and its compilation to streaming string transducers with worst-case linear-time performance. Its underlying theory is based on transducer decomposition into oracle and action machines, and a finite-state specialization of the streaming parsing algorithm presented in the first part.

However, this is not true in the real world. In fact, cells and int racellular proteins have a well-defined lifetime. Inspired from these biological facts, we define a m odel of systems of mobile membranes in which each membrane and each object has a timer representing their lifetime. We show that systems of mutual mobile membranes with and without timers have the same computational power. An encoding of timed safe mobile ambients into systems of mutual mobile membranes with timers offers a relationship between two formalisms used in describing biological systems. Membrane systems are essentially parallel and nondeterministic computing models inspired by the compartments of eukaryotic cells and their biochemical reactions. The structure of the cell is represented by a set of hierarchically embedded regions, each one delimited by a surrounding boundary (called membrane), and all of them contained inside an external special membrane called skin. The molecular species (ions, proteins, etc.) floating inside cellular com partments are represented by multisets of objects described by means of symbols or strings over a given alphabet. The objects can be modified or communicated between adjacent compartments. Chemical reactions are represented by evolution rules which operate on the objects, as well as on the compartmentalized structure (by dissolving, dividing, creating, or moving membranes). A membrane system can perform computations in the following way: starting from an initial configuration which is defined by the multiset of objects initial ly placed inside the membranes, the system evolves by applying the evolution rules of each membrane in a nondeterministic and maximally parallel manner. A rule is applicable when all the objects which appear in its left hand side are available in the region where the rule is placed. The maximally parallel way of using the rules means that in each step, in each region of the system, we apply a maximal multiset of rules, namely a multiset of rules such that no further rule can be added to the set. A halting configuration i s reached when no rule is applicable. The result is represented by the number of objects from a specifie d membrane. Several variants of membrane systems are inspired by different aspects of living cells (symport and antiport-based communication through membranes, catalytic objects, membrane charge, etc.). Their computing power and efficiency have been investigated using the approaches of formal languages and grammars, register machines and complexity theory. Membrane systems (also called P systems) are presented together with many variants and examples in [33]. Several applications of these systems are presented in [20]. An updated bibliography can be found at the P systems web page [35]. A first attempt to define mobile P systems is presented in [34] w here the rules are similar to those of mobile ambients [10].

For deterministic automata on infinite words, no canonical minimal automaton exists, and a language may have different minimal deterministic Buchi (DBW) or co-Buchi (DCW) automata. In recent years, researchers have studied {\\em good-for-games\\/} (GFG) automata -- nondeterministic automata that can resolve their nondeterministic choices in a way that only depends on the past. Several applications of automata in formal methods, most notably synthesis, that are traditionally based on deterministic automata, can instead be based on GFG automata. The {\\em minimization\\/} problem for DBW and DCW is NP-complete, and it stays NP-complete for GFG Buchi and co-Buchi automata. On the other hand, minimization of GFG co-Buchi automata with {\\em transition-based\\/} acceptance (GFG-tNCWs) can be solved in polynomial time. In these automata, acceptance is defined by a set $\\alpha$ of transitions, and a run is accepting if it traverses transitions in $\\alpha$ only finitely often. This raises the question of canonicity of minimal deterministic and GFG automata with transition-based acceptance. In this paper we study this problem. We start with GFG-tNCWs and show that the safe components (that is, these obtained by restricting the transitions to these not in $\\alpha$) of all minimal GFG-tNCWs are isomorphic, and that by saturating the automaton with transitions in $\\alpha$ we get isomorphism among all minimal GFG-tNCWs. Thus, a canonical form for minimal GFG-tNCWs can be obtained in polynomial time. We continue to DCWs with transition-based acceptance (tDCWs), and their dual tDBWs. We show that here, while no canonical form for minimal automata exists, restricting attention to the safe components is useful, and implies that the only minimal tDCWs that have no canonical form are these for which the transition to the GFG model results in strictly smaller automaton, which do have a canonical minimal form.", "venue": "GandALF", "authors": ["Bader Abu Radi", "Orna  Kupferman"], "year": 2020, "n_citations": 3}

Multiple interactions of finite state machines in complex systems are well captured by the notion of non-flat systems. Non--flat systems are \"finite state machines\" where each \"state\" can be either a basic state or an aggregate of finite state machines. By expanding a non-flat system, a flat system is obtained which is an ordinary finite state machine. In this paper we introduce a novel class of non--flat systems called Arena of Finite State Machines (AFSM). AFSMs are collections of finite state machines that interact concurrently through a communication network. We propose a notion of compositional bisimulation that allows checking bisimulation equivalence of AFSMs by directly exploiting their communication networks and hence, without the need of expanding the AFSMs to finite state machines. Compositional bisimulation allows a computational complexity reduction when checking bisimulation equivalence of AFSMs, as formally quantified in the paper.

The proof relies on a construction of a tree automaton recognizing all cycles in the weighted graph corresponding to every unfolding tree of the Horn system. We constrain the tree to recognize only cycles of negative weight by adding a Presburger formula that harnesses the number of times each rule is fired, and reduce our problem to the universality of a Presburger-constrained tree automaton. We studied the complexity of this problem and found it to be in \\textsc{NEXPtime} with an \\textsc{EXPtime}-hard lower bound.

The formalism of labelled sequents has been successful in that cut-free calculi in possession of desirable proof-theoretic properties can be automatically generated for large classes of logics. Despite these qualities, labelled systems make use of a complicated syntax that explicitly incorporates the semantics of the associated logic, and such systems typically violate the subformula property to a high degree. By contrast, nested sequent calculi employ a simpler syntax and adhere to a strict reading of the subformula property, making such systems useful in the design of automated reasoning algorithms. However, the downside of the nested sequent paradigm is that a general theory concerning the automated construction of such calculi (as in the labelled setting) is essentially absent, meaning that the construction of nested systems and the confirmation of their properties is usually done on a case-by-case basis. The refinement method connects both paradigms in a fruitful way, by transforming labelled systems into nested (or, refined labelled) systems with the properties of the former preserved throughout the transformation process. To demonstrate the method of refinement and some of its applications, we consider grammar logics, first-order intuitionistic logics, and deontic STIT logics. The introduced refined labelled calculi will be used to provide the first proof-search algorithms for deontic STIT logics.

We introduce nondeterministic SSTs over infinite strings (\u03c9-NSSTs) and show that they precisely capture the relations definable in MSO. We further explore theoretical properties of \u03c9-NSSTs required to effectively carry out regular model checking. In particular, we establish that the regular type checking problem for \u03c9-NSSTs is decidable in Pspace. Since the post-image of a regular language under a regular relation may not be regular (or even context-free), approaches that iteratively compute the image can not be effectively carried out in this setting. Instead, we utilize the fact that regular relations are closed under composition, which, together with our decidability result, provides a foundation for regular model checking with regular relations.", "venue": "FCT", "authors": ["Vrunda  Dave", "Taylor  Dohmen", "Shankara Narayana Krishna", "Ashutosh  Trivedi"], "year": 2021, "n_citations": 0}

As compressed forms of the documents we use straight-line programs (SLPs) --- a lossless compression scheme for textual data widely used in different areas of theoretical computer science and particularly well-suited for algorithmics on compressed data. In data complexity, our results are as follows. For a regular spanner M and an SLP $\\mathcalS $ of size $\\mathbfs $ that represents a document D, we can solve the tasks of model checking and of checking non-emptiness in time $O(\\mathbfs )$. Computing the set $\u0142lbracket M \\rrbracket(D)$ of all span-tuples extracted from D can be done in time $\u00d8(\\mathbfs |\u0142lbracket M \\rrbracket(D)|)$, and enumeration of $\u0142lbracket M \\rrbracket(D)$ can be done with linear preprocessing $O(\\mathbfs )$ and a delay of $O(depth\\mathcalS )$, where $depth\\mathcalS $ is the depth of $\\mathcalS $'s derivation tree. Note that $\\mathbfs $ can be exponentially smaller than the document's size $|D|$; and, due to known balancing results for SLPs, we can always assume that $depth\\mathcalS = O(log(|D|))$ independent of D's compressibility. Hence, our enumeration algorithm has a delay logarithmic in the size of the non-compressed data and a preprocessing time that is at best (i.e., in the case of highly compressible documents) also logarithmic, but at worst still linear. Therefore, in a big-data perspective, our enumeration algorithm for SLP-compressed documents may nevertheless beat the known linear preprocessing and constant delay algorithms for non-compressed documents.", "venue": "PODS", "authors": ["Markus L.

Perfect language classes are the basis for the automata-theoretic approach to model checking: a system is correct if the language generated by the system is disjoint from the language of bad traces. Regular languages are perfect, but because the disjointness problem for context-free languages is undecidable, no class containing them can be perfect. In practice, verification problems for language classes that are not perfect are often under-approximated by checking if the property holds for all behaviors of the system belonging to a fixed subset. A general way to specify a subset of behaviors is by using bounded languages. A class of languages C is perfect modulo bounded languages if it is closed under Boolean operations relative to every bounded language, and if the emptiness problem is decidable relative to every bounded language.

The algorithm amounts to a procedure that transforms a grammar of order n to a grammar of order n-1, preserving nonemptiness, and increasing the size only exponentially. After repeating the procedure n times, we obtain a grammar of order 0, whose nonemptiness can be easily checked. Since the size grows exponentially at each step, the overall complexity is n-EXPTIME, which is known to be optimal. More precisely, the transformation (and hence the whole algorithm) is linear in the size of the grammar, assuming that the arity of employed nonterminals is bounded by a constant. The same algorithm allows to check whether an infinite tree generated by a higher-order recursion scheme is accepted by an alternating safety (or reachability) automaton, because this question can be reduced to the nonemptiness problem by taking a product of the recursion scheme with the automaton. \nA proof of correctness of the algorithm is formalised in the proof assistant Coq.

Message formats in XML-based protocols are usually specified in XML Schema, and as a first-line defense, schema validation should reject malformed input. However, extension points in most protocol specifications break validation. Extension points are wildcards and considered best practice for loose composition, but they also enable an attacker to add unchecked content in a document, e.g., for a signature wrapping attack. This paper introduces datatyped XML visibly pushdown automata (dXVPAs) as language representation for mixed-content XML and presents an incremental learner that infers a dXVPA from example documents. The learner generalizes XML types and datatypes in terms of automaton states and transitions, and an inferred dXVPA converges to a good-enough approximation of the true language. The automaton is free from extension points and capable of stream validation, e.g., as an anomaly detector for XML-based protocols. For dealing with adversarial training data, two scenarios of poisoning are considered: a poisoning attack is either uncovered at a later time or remains hidden. Unlearning can therefore remove an identified poisoning attack from a dXVPA, and sanitization trims low-frequent states and transitions to get rid of hidden attacks. All algorithms have been evaluated in four scenarios, including a web service implemented in Apache Axis2 and Apache Rampart, where attacks have been simulated. In all scenarios, the learned automaton had zero false positives and outperformed traditional schema validation.", "venue": "2016 IEEE Security and Privacy Workshops (SPW)", "authors": ["Harald  Lampesberger"], "year": 2016, "n_citations": 1}

We show that the maximum number of squares xx such that x is not a primitive word (nonprimitive squares) in a word of length n is exactly $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2}\\right\\rfloor - 1$, and the maximum number of subwords of the form x k , for k ? 3, is exactly n ? 2. In particular, the maximum number of cubes in a word is not greater than n ? 2 either. Using very technical properties of occurrences of cubes, we improve this bound significantly. We show that the maximum number of cubes in a word of length n is between $\\frac{45}{100}\\;n$ and $\\frac{4}{5}\\;n$.", "venue": "IWOCA", "authors": ["Marcin  Kubica", "Jakub  Radoszewski", "Wojciech  Rytter", "Tomasz  Walen"], "year": 2009, "n_citations": 7}

The present work relaxes this restriction by revising a different graph grammar formalism called Vertex Replacement Grammars (VRGs). We show that a variant of the VRG called Clustering-based Node Replacement Grammar (CNRG) can be efficiently extracted from many hierarchical clusterings of a graph. We show that CNRGs encode a succinct model of the graph, yet faithfully preserves the structure of the original graph.

Although this theory is widely used, e.g., to check conformance of protocol implementations, its applicability is limited by restrictions of the FSM framework: the fact that inputs and outputs alternate in an FSM, and outputs are fully determined by the previous input and state. Labeled Transition Systems with inputs and outputs (LTSs), as studied in ioco testing theory, provide a richer framework for testing component oriented systems, but lack the algorithms for test generation from FSM theory. \nIn this article, we propose an algorithm for the fundamental problem of state identification during testing of LTSs. Our algorithm is a direct generalization of the well-known algorithm for computing adaptive distinguishing sequences for FSMs proposed by Lee & Yannakakis. Our algorithm has to deal with so-called compatible states, states that cannot be distinguished in case of an adversarial system-under-test. Analogous to the result of Lee & Yannakakis, we prove that if an (adaptive) test exists that distinguishes all pairs of incompatible states of an LTS, our algorithm will find one. In practice, such adaptive tests typically do not exist. However, in experiments with an implementation of our algorithm on an industrial benchmark, we find that that tests produced by our algorithm still distinguish more than 99% of the incompatible state pairs.", "venue": "FACS", "authors": ["Petra van den Bos", "Frits  Vaandrager"], "year": 2019, "n_citations": 0}

Under a probabilistic assumption about the possible inputs, such a preference order is naturally expressed by a weighted automaton, which assigns to each word a value, such that a system is preferred if it generates a higher expected value. We solve the following optimal synthesis problem: given an omega-regular specification, a Markov chain that describes the distribution of inputs, and a weighted automaton that measures how well a system satisfies the given specification under the input assumption, synthesize a system that optimizes the measured value. For safety specifications and quantitative measures that are defined by mean-payoff automata, the optimal synthesis problem reduces to finding a strategy in a Markov decision process (MDP) that is optimal for a long-run average reward objective, which can be achieved in polynomial time. For general omega-regular specifications along with mean-payoff automata, the solution rests on a new, polynomial-time algorithm for computing optimal strategies in MDPs with mean-payoff parity objectives. Our algorithm constructs optimal strategies that consist of two memoryless strategies and a counter. The counter is in general not bounded. To obtain a finite-state system, we show how to construct an \u03b5-optimal strategy with a bounded counter, for all \u03b5 > 0. Furthermore, we show how to decide in polynomial time if it is possible to construct an optimal finite-state system (i.e., a system without a counter) for a given specification.

We study how to do reactive synthesis when part of the specification of the system is that its behavior should be random. Randomness can be useful, for example, in a network protocol fuzz tester whose output should be varied, or a planner for a surveillance robot whose route should be unpredictable. However, existing reactive synthesis techniques do not provide a way to ensure random behavior while maintaining functional correctness. Towards this end, we generalize the recently-proposed framework of control improvisation (CI) to add reactivity. The resulting framework of reactive control improvisation provides a natural way to integrate a randomness requirement with the usual functional specifications of reactive synthesis over a finite window. We theoretically characterize when such problems are realizable, and give a general method for solving them. For specifications given by reachability or safety games or by deterministic finite automata, our method yields a polynomial-time synthesis algorithm. For various other types of specifications including temporal logic formulas, we obtain a polynomial-space algorithm and prove matching PSPACE-hardness results.

However, the class of Wheeler graphs is rather small: for example, a unary language is recognized by some Wheeler automaton (that is, an automaton whose underlying graph is Wheeler) if and only if the language is finite or cofinite. In [SODA 2021] these ideas where extended to arbitrary node-labeled graphs, and Wheeler orders were generalized to co-lex orders, which are partial orders: it was showed that a node-labeled graphs G = (V,E) can be succinctly indexed by means of a data structure of |E|(\u2308log |\u03a3|\u2309+\u2308log p\u2309+2) \u00b7(1+o(1))+ |V | \u00b7(1+o(1)) bits which supports pattern matching in O(|P | \u00b7 p \u00b7 log(p \u00b7 |\u03a3|)) time, where p is the minimum width of a co-lex order on G, P is the pattern and \u03a3 is the alphabet. However, determining p is NP-hard and building the data structure is also hard. Intuitively, a partial order imposes antisymmetry and transitivity constraints, which cause the hardness of all natural decision problems connected to Wheeler and co-lex orders. In this paper, we change perspective switching from (partial) orders to arbitrary relations, so defining co-lex relations. We work in the more general setting of edge-labeled graphs G = (V,E), and for the first time we provide a succinct index for arbitrary graphs that can be built in polynomial time, which requires less space and answers queries more efficiently than the one in [SODA 2021]. We show that, given an edge-labeled graph G = (V,E), there exists a data structure of |E/\u2264G |(\u2308log |\u03a3|\u2309 + \u2308log q\u2309 + 2) \u00b7 (1 + o(1)) + |V/\u2264G | \u00b7 (1 + o(1)) bits which supports pattern matching on G in O(|P | \u00b7 q \u00b7 log(q \u00b7 |\u03a3|)) time, where G/\u2264G = (V/\u2264G , E/\u2264G) is a quotient graph obtained by collapsing some nodes in G (so |V/\u2264G | \u2264 |V | and |E/\u2264G | \u2264 |E|) and q is the width of the maximum co-lex relation on G. The bounds achieved in this paper look similar to the ones in [SODA 2021], but, in fact, there are several sources of improvement: 1. Most importantly, q can be determined in O(|E|) time, and our data structure can be built in O(|E| + |V/\u2264G | ) time (while determining p and building the data structure in [SODA 2021] are hard problems). 2. It always holds q \u2264 p, and q can be arbitrarily smaller than p (that is, for every integer n there exists a graph such that p = n and q = 1). 3. Our bound only depends on the size of G/\u2264G and it is independent of the size of G. In other words, the quotient graph G/\u2264G eliminates the unnecessary redundancy in G from a pattern matching perspective. Our results have relevant applications in automata theory. First, we can build a succinct data structure to decide whether a string is accepted by a given automaton. Second, starting from an automaton A, one can define a relation A and a quotient automaton that capture the nondeterminism of A, improving the results in [SODA 2021].", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Nicola  Cotumaccio"], "year": 2021, "n_citations": 0}

From this hypothesis, it naturally follows that the degree-3 directed graph connectivity problem (3DSTCON) parameterized by the number of vertices in a given graph cannot belong to PsubLIN, composed of all parameterized decision problems computable by polynomial-time, sub-linear-space deterministic Turing machines. This hypothesis immediately implies L\u2260NL and it was used as a solid foundation to obtain new lower bounds on the computational complexity of various NL search and NL optimization problems. The state complexity of transformation refers to the cost of converting one type of finite automata to another type, where the cost is measured in terms of the increase of the number of inner states of the converted automata from that of the original automata. We relate the linear space hypothesis to the state complexity of transforming restricted 2-way nondeterministic finite automata to computationally equivalent 2-way alternating finite automata having narrow computation graphs. For this purpose, we present state complexity characterizations of 3DSTCON and PsubLIN.

Unfortunately, whenever the format of the textual representation has to be modified, changes have to propagated throughout the entire language processor tool chain. These updates are time-consuming, tedious, and error-prone. Besides, in case different applications use the same language, several copies of the same language specification have to be maintained.

This theory suggests, and our result proves, that small differences in the nature of adhesive bindings between abstract square molecules gives rise to vastly different expressive capabilities. In the cooperative abstract Tile Assembly Model, square tiles attach to each other using multi-sided cooperation of one, two or more sides. This precise control of tile binding is directly exploited for algorithmic tasks including growth of specified shapes using very few tile types, as well as simulation of Turing machines and even self-simulation of self-assembly systems. But are cooperative bindings required for these computational tasks? The definitionally simpler noncooperative (or Temperature 1) model has poor control over local binding events: tiles stick if they bind on at least one side. This has led to the conjecture that it is impossible for it to exhibit precisely controlled growth of computationally-defined shapes. Here, we prove such an impossibility result. We show that any planar noncooperative system that attempts to grow large algorithmically-controlled tile-efficient assemblies must also grow infinite non-algorithmic (pumped) structures with a simple closed-form description, or else suffer blocking of intended algorithmic structures.

The central algorithmic problem for Petri nets is reachability: whether from the given initial configuration there exists a sequence of valid execution steps that reaches the given final configuration. The complexity of the problem has remained unsettled since the 1960s, and it is one of the most prominent open questions in the theory of verification. Decidability was proved by Mayr in his seminal STOC 1981 work, and, currently, the best published upper bound is non-primitive recursive Ackermannian of Leroux and Schmitz from Symposium on Logic in Computer Science 2019. We establish a non-elementary lower bound, i.e., that the reachability problem needs a tower of exponentials of time and space. Until this work, the best lower bound has been exponential space, due to Lipton in 1976. The new lower bound is a major breakthrough for several reasons. Firstly, it shows that the reachability problem is much harder than the coverability (i.e., state reachability) problem, which is also ubiquitous but has been known to be complete for exponential space since the late 1970s. Secondly, it implies that a plethora of problems from formal languages, logic, concurrent systems, process calculi, and other areas, which are known to admit reductions from the Petri nets reachability problem, are also not elementary. Thirdly, it makes obsolete the current best lower bounds for the reachability problems for two key extensions of Petri nets: with branching and with a pushdown stack. We develop a construction that uses arbitrarily large pairs of values with ratio R to provide zero testable counters that are bounded by R. At the heart of our proof is then a novel gadget, the so-called factorial amplifier that, assuming availability of counters that are zero testable and bounded by k, guarantees to produce arbitrarily large pairs of values whose ratio is exactly the factorial of k. Repeatedly composing the factorial amplifier with itself by means of the former construction enables us to compute, in linear time, Petri nets that simulate Minsky machines whose counters are bounded by a tower of exponentials, which yields the non-elementary lower bound.

We define various classes of languages based on different sets of atomic operations, and compare their expressive powers.

To this end we study a faster-than relation for semi-Markov decision processes and compare it to standard notions for relating systems. We consider the compositional aspects of this relation, and show that the faster-than relation is not a precongruence with respect to parallel composition, hence giving rise to so-called parallel timing anomalies.

All such hierarchies are built through the same construction process: one starts from an initial, specific class of languages (the basis) and builds new levels using two generic operations. Concatenation hierarchies have gathered a lot of interest since the early 70s, notably thanks to an alternate logical definition: each concatenation hierarchy can be defined as the quantification alternation hierarchy within a variant of first-order logic over words (while the hierarchies differ by their bases, the variants differ by their set of available predicates). Our goal is to understand these hierarchies. A typical approach is to look at two decision problems: membership and separation. In the paper we are interested in the latter, which is more general. For a class of languages $C$, C-separation takes two regular languages as input and asks whether there exists a third one in $C$ including the first one and disjoint from the second one. Settling whether separation is decidable for the levels within a given concatenation hierarchy is among the most fundamental and challenging questions in formal language theory. In all prominent cases, it is open, or answered positively for low levels only. Recently, a breakthrough was made using a generic approach for a specific kind of hierarchies: those with a finite basis. In this case. separation is always decidable for levels 1/2. 1 and 3/2. Our main theorem is similar but independent: we consider hierarchies with possibly infinite bases, but that contain only group languages. An example is the group hierarchy introduced by Pin and Margolis: its basis consists of all group languages. Another example is the quantifier alternation hierarchy of first-order logic with modular predicates FO($<$, MOD): its basis consists of the languages that count the length of words modulo some number. Using a generic approach, we show that for any such hierarchy, if separation is decidable for the basis, then it is decidable as well for levels 1/2, 1 and 3/2 (we actually solve a more general problem called covering). This complements the aforementioned result nicely: all bases considered in the literature are either finite or made of group languages.

Our main result is a generalization of the classical Myhill-Nerode theorem to this symbolic setting. Our generalization requires the use of three relations to capture the additional structure of register automata. Location equivalence $\\equiv_l$ captures that symbolic traces end in the same location, transition equivalence $\\equiv_t$ captures that they share the same final transition, and a partial equivalence relation $\\equiv_r$ captures that symbolic values $v$ and $v'$ are stored in the same register after symbolic traces $w$ and $w'$, respectively. A symbolic language is defined to be regular if relations $\\equiv_l$, $\\equiv_t$ and $\\equiv_r$ exist that satisfy certain conditions, in particular, they all have finite index. We show that the symbolic language associated to a register automaton is regular, and we construct, for each regular symbolic language, a register automaton that accepts this language.

The Strahler number of a parity game is proposed to be defined as the smallest Strahler number of the tree of any of its attractor decompositions. It is proved that parity games can be solved in quasi-linear space and in time that is polynomial in the number of vertices~$n$ and linear in $({d}/{2k})^k$, where $d$ is the number of priorities and $k$ is the Strahler number. This complexity is quasi-polynomial because the Strahler number is at most logarithmic in the number of vertices. The proof is based on a new construction of small Strahler-universal trees. \nIt is shown that the Strahler number of a parity game is a robust parameter: it coincides with its alternative version based on trees of progress measures and with the register number defined by Lehtinen~(2018). It follows that parity games can be solved in quasi-linear space and in time that is polynomial in the number of vertices and linear in $({d}/{2k})^k$, where $k$ is the register number. This significantly improves the running times and space achieved for parity games of bounded register number by Lehtinen (2018) and by Parys (2020). \nThe running time of the algorithm based on small Strahler-universal trees yields a novel trade-off $k \\cdot \\lg(d/k) = O(\\log n)$ between the two natural parameters that measure the structural complexity of a parity game, which allows solving parity games in polynomial time.

Moreover, this question has motivated the development of a new method called visible glues. We believe that this method can also be used to tackle other long-standing problems in computational geometry, in relation for instance with self-avoiding paths. \nTile assembly (including non-cooperative tile assembly) was originally introduced by Winfree and Rothemund in STOC 2000 to understand how to program shapes. The non-cooperative variant, also known as temperature 1 tile assembly, is the model where tiles are allowed to bind as soon as they match on one side, whereas in cooperative tile assembly, some tiles need to match on several sides in order to bind. In this work, we prove that only very simple shapes can indeed be programmed, whereas exactly one known result (SODA 2014) showed a restriction on the assemblies general non-cooperative self-assembly could achieve, without any implication on its computational expressiveness.

Formal verification provides ways of establishing correctness guarantees, which can be quite important for such safety-critical applications.

In this paper, we, thus, start the other way around with hybrid programs that include continuous plant models in addition to discrete control algorithms. Correctness properties of hybrid programs can be formally verified in the theorem prover KeYmaera X that implements differential dynamic logic, dL, for hybrid programs. After verifying the hybrid program, we now present an approach for translating hybrid programs into PLC code. The new HyPLC tool implements this translation of discrete control code of verified hybrid program models to PLC controller code and, vice versa, the translation of existing PLC code into the discrete control actions for a hybrid program given an additional input of the continuous dynamics of the system to be verified. This approach allows for the generation of real controller code while preserving, by compilation, the correctness of a valid and verified hybrid program.

For concerns of safety, economy, and convenience, it is important that such systems work correctly. However, it is a notoriously difficult task to ensure that the software running on computers behaves correctly. \nOne approach to ease this task is that of model checking, where a model of the system is made using some mathematical formalism. Requirements expressed in a formal language can then be verified against the model in order to give guarantees that the model satisfies the requirements. \nFor many computer systems, time is an important factor. As such, we need our formalisms and requirement languages to be able to incorporate real time. \nWe therefore develop formalisms and algorithms that allow us to compare and express properties about real-time systems. We first introduce a logical formalism for reasoning about upper and lower bounds on time, and study the properties of this formalism, including axiomatisation and algorithms for checking when a formula is satisfied. \nWe then consider the question of when a system is faster than another system. We show that this is a difficult question which can not be answered in general, but we identify special cases where this question can be answered. We also show that under this notion of faster-than, a local increase in speed may lead to a global decrease in speed, and we take step towards avoiding this. \nFinally, we consider how to compare the real-time behaviour of systems not just qualitatively, but also quantitatively. Thus, we are interested in knowing how much one system is faster or slower than another system. This is done by introducing a distance between systems.

In the theory of MSTs, a global type specifies the interaction among the roles at the global level. A local specification for each role is generated by projecting from the global type on to the message exchanges it participates in. Whenever a global type can be projected on to each role, the composition of the projections is deadlock free and has exactly the behaviours specified by the global type. The key to the usability of MSTs is the projection operation: a more expressive projection allows more systems to be type-checked but requires a more difficult soundness argument. In this paper, we generalise the standard projection operation in MSTs. This allows us to model and type-check many design patterns in distributed systems, such as load balancing, that are rejected by the standard projection. The key to the new projection is an analysis that tracks causality between messages. Our soundness proof uses novel graph-theoretic techniques from the theory of message-sequence charts.

Here we use an opposite approach, increasing the power of 2dfas to the degree for which it is still possible to obtain a subexponential conversion from the stronger model to the standard 2dfas. In particular, it turns out that subexponential conversion is possible for two-way automata that make nondeterministic choices only when the input head scans one of the input tape endmarkers. However, there is no restriction on the input head movement. This implies that an exponential gap between 2nfas and 2dfas can be obtained only for unrestricted 2nfas using capabilities beyond the proposed new model. \n \nAs an additional bonus, conversion into a machine for the complement of the original language is polynomial in this model. The same holds for making such machines self-verifying, halting, or unambiguous. Finally, any superpolynomial lower bound for the simulation of such machines by standard 2dfas would imply L\u2260NL. In the same way, the alternating version of these machines is related to L \u225f NL \u225f P, the classical computational complexity problems.", "venue": "Inf.

Most algorithms relative to these systems only use this fact to select vertices. For infinite state systems, however, the situation is different: in particular, for such systems having a finite description, each state of the system is a configuration of some machine. Then most algorithmic approaches rely on the structure of these configurations. Such characterisations are said internal. In order to apply algorithms detecting a structural property (like identifying connected components) one may have first to transform the system in order to fit the description needed for the algorithm. The problem of internal characterisation is that it hides structural properties, and each solution becomes ad hoc relatively to the form of the configurations. On the contrary, external characterisations avoid explicit naming of the vertices. Such characterisation are mostly defined via graph transformations. In this paper we present two kind of external characterisations: deterministic graph rewriting, which in turn characterise regular graphs, deterministic context-free languages, and rational graphs. Inverse substitution from a generator (like the complete binary tree) provides characterisation for prefix-recognizable graphs, the Caucal Hierarchy and rational graphs.

This notion of primality was introduced by Kupferman and Mosheiff in 2013, and while they proved that we can decide whether a DFA is composite, the precise complexity of this problem is still open, with a doubly-exponential gap between the upper and lower bounds. In this work, we focus on permutation DFAs, i.e., those for which the transition monoid is a group. We provide an NP algorithm to decide whether a permutation DFA is composite, and show that the difficulty of this problem comes from the number of non-accepting states of the instance: we give a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm with the number of rejecting states as the parameter. Moreover, we investigate the class of commutative permutation DFAs. Their structural properties allow us to decide compositionality in NL, and even in LOGSPACE if the alphabet size is fixed. Despite this low complexity, we show that complex behaviors still arise in this class: we provide a family of composite DFAs each requiring polynomially many factors with respect to its size. We also consider the variant of the problem that asks whether a DFA is k-factor composite, that is, decomposable into k smaller DFAs, for some given integer k \u2208 N.

A celebrated theorem by Agafonov states that a sequence {\\alpha} is normal iff every finite-state selector. Normality is generalised to arbitrary probability maps \\mu: {\\alpha} is is \\mu-distributed if, for every finite string w, the limiting frequency of w in {\\alpha} exists and equals \\mu(w). Unlike normality, \\mu-distributedness is not preserved by finite-state selectors for all probability maps \\mu. This raises the question of how to characterize the probability maps \\mu for which \\mu-distributedness is preserved across finite-state selection, or equivalently, by selection by programs using constant space. \nWe prove the following result: for any finite or countably infinite alphabet {\\Sigma}, every finite-state selector over {\\Sigma} selects a \\mu-distributed sequence from every \\mu-distributed sequence {\\alpha} iff \\mu is induced by a Bernoulli distribution on {\\Sigma}, that is a probability distribution on the alphabet extended to words by taking the product. The primary -- and remarkable -- consequence of our main result is a complete characterization of the set of probability maps, on finite and infinite alphabets, for which Agafonov-type results hold. The main positive takeaway is that (the appropriate generalization of) Agafonov's Theorem holds for Bernoulli distributions (rather than just equidistributions) on both finite and countably infinite alphabets.

This concerns namely techniques for size reduction and language inclusion testing, which are two problems that are crucial for many applications of tree automata. For size reduction of tree automata, we adapt the simulation quotient technique that is well established for finite word automata. We give efficient algorithms for computing tree automata simulations and we also introduce a new type of relation that arises from a combination of tree automata downward and upward simulation and that is very well suited for quotienting. The combination principle is relevant also for word automata. We then generalise the so called antichain universality and language inclusion checking technique developed originally for finite word automata for tree automata. Subsequently, we improve the antichain technique for both word and tree automata by combining it with the simulation-based inclusion checking techniques, significantly improving efficiency of the antichain method. We then show how the developed reduction and inclusion checking methods improve the method of abstract regular tree model checking, the method that was the original motivation for starting the work on tree automata. Both the reduction and the language inclusion methods are based on relatively simple and general principles that can be further extended for other types of automata and related formalisms.

A careful observation reveals that the size of the system is presented in such arguments as the size of its state space. This view is slightly biased, in that the state space can be exponentially larger than the size of a reasonable implementation like a circuit or program.

If the abstract state space is finite, convergence is guaranteed; the challenge is to catch the point k_max where it happens. We further demonstrate how simple invariants formulated over the concrete domain can be used to eliminate spurious abstract states, which otherwise prevent the sequence from converging. We have implemented our technique for the P programming language for event-driven programs.

We consider algebras for a monad T on a category D and we study (pseudo)varieties of T-algebras. Pseudovarieties of algebras are also known in the literature as varieties of finite algebras. Two well-known theorems that characterize varieties and pseudovarieties of algebras play an important role here: Birkhoff's theorem and Birkhoff's theorem for finite algebras, the latter also known as Reiterman's theorem. We prove, under mild assumptions, a categorical version of Birkhoff's theorem for (finite) algebras to establish a one-to-one correspondence between (pseudo)varieties of T-algebras and (pseudo)equational T-theories. Now, if C is a category that is dual to D and B is the comonad on C that is the dual of T, we get a one-to-one correspondence between (pseudo)equational T-theories and their dual, (pseudo)coequational B-theories. Particular instances of (pseudo)coequational B-theories have been already studied in language theory under the name of \"varieties of languages\" to establish Eilenberg-type correspondences. All in all, we get a one-to-one correspondence between (pseudo)varieties of T-algebras and (pseudo)coequational B-theories, which will be shown to be exactly the nature of Eilenberg-type correspondences.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Julian  Salamanca"], "year": 2017, "n_citations": 10}

In this paper we develop an abstraction theory for asynchronous multi-valued network models that allows the state space of a model to be reduced while preserving key properties of the model. The abstraction theory therefore provides a mechanism for coping with the state space explosion problem and supports the analysis and comparison of multi-valued networks. We take as our starting point the abstraction theory for synchronous multi-valued networks which is based on the finite set of traces that represent the behaviour of such a model. The problem with extending this approach to the asynchronous case is that we can now have an infinite set of traces associated with a model making a simple trace inclusion test infeasible. To address this we develop a decision procedure for checking asynchronous abstractions based on using the finite state graph of an asynchronous multi-valued network to reason about its trace semantics. We illustrate the abstraction techniques developed by considering a detailed case study based on a multi-valued network model of the regulation of tryptophan biosynthesis in Escherichia coli.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["L.

Their behaviours can be formalized either as weighted language equivalence or weighted bisimulation. In this paper we explore the properties of weighted automata in the framework of coalgebras over (i) the category SMod of semimodules over a semiring K and K-linear maps, and (ii) the category Set of sets and maps. We show that the behavioural equivalences defined by the corresponding final coalgebras in these two cases characterize weighted language equivalence and weighted bisimulation, respectively. These results extend earlier work by Bonchi et al. using the category Vect of vector spaces and linear maps as the underlying model for weighted automata with weights drawn from a field K. The key step in our work is generalizing the notions of linear relations and linear bisimulations of Boreale from vector spaces to semimodules using the concept of the kernel of a K-linear map in the sense of universal algebra. We also provide an abstract procedure for forward partition refinement for computing weighted language equivalence. Since for weighted automata defined over semirings the problem is undecidable in general, it is guaranteed to halt only in special cases.

Introduction In Computability Theory (Recursion Theory) in the first step we wish to recognize the sets which could be enumerated by Turing machines (equivalently, algorithms) and in the next step we will compare these sets by some reasonable order (Like Turing degree). Also sometimes with some extra information (Oracles) a class of non c.e. sets show the same behavior as c.e. sets (Post hierarchy and related theorems). Here we try another approach: \"Let A be an arbitrary set and we wish to recognize how much this set might be covered by a c.e. set?\" Although in some sense this approach could be seen in some definitions of Recursion Theory, but at the best of our knowledge it didn't considered as an approach yet, even though it is able to shed a light on some subjects of Computability of sets. Defining this approach is not quite straightforward and there are some obstacles to define them. To overcome these difficulties we modify the definitions. We have an alternative problem here when we consider recursive sets and not c.e. sets. In this case, the problem would be: \"Let A be an arbitrary set and we wish to know that how much this set might be covered by a recursive Set?\" Here, we try the first definition and the first problem.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Farzad  Didehvar", "Mohsen  Mansouri", "Zahra  Taheri"], "year": 2012, "n_citations": 0}

Among the most popular algorithms are those for automated process discovery, whose ultimate goal is to generate the best process model that summarizes the behaviour recorded in the input event log. Over the past decade, several process discovery algorithms have been proposed but, until now, this research was driven by the implicit assumption that a better algorithm would discover better process models, no matter the characteristics of the input event log. In this paper, we take a step back and question that assumption. Specifically, we investigate what are the relations between measures capturing characteristics of the input event log and the quality of the discovered process models. To this end, we review the state-of-the-art process complexity measures, propose a new process complexity measure based on graph entropy, and analyze this set of complexity measures on an extensive collection of event logs and corresponding automatically discovered process models. Our analysis shows that many process complexity measures correlate with the quality of the discovered process models, demonstrating the potential of using complexity measures as predictors for the quality of process models discovered with state-of-the-art process discovery algorithms.

Formal grammars, typically in the form of BNF-like productions, describe the language syntax, which is then annotated for syntax-directed translation and completed with semantic actions. When, apart from the textual representation of data, an explicit representation of the corresponding data structure is required, the language designer has to devise the mapping between the suitable data model and its proper language specification, and then develop the conversion procedure from the parse tree to the data model instance. Unfortunately, whenever the format of the textual representation has to be modified, changes have to propagated throughout the entire language processor tool chain. These updates are time-consuming, tedious, and error-prone. Besides, in case different applications use the same language, several copies of the same language specification have to be maintained. In this paper, we introduce ModelCC, a model-based parser generator that decouples language specification from language processing, hence avoiding many of the problems caused by grammar-driven parsers and parser generators. ModelCC incorporates reference resolution within the parsing process. Therefore, instead of returning mere abstract syntax trees, ModelCC is able to obtain abstract syntax graphs from input strings.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Luis  Quesada", "Fernando Berzal Galiano", "Juan C.

The waves generated by activating processes in a digital environment can be used for designing a variety of wave algorithms. In this chapter we aim to study the geometrical shapes of informational waves on integer grid generated in broadcasting automata model as well as their potential use for metric approximation in a discrete space. An exploration of the ability to vary the broadcasting radius of each node leads to results of categorisations of digital discs, their form, composition, encodings and generation.

With this survey article we give an overview about relevant research to this topic during the last twenty years including own investigations and some new results. In Section 1 after recalling the most important notions from formal language theory we illustrate the connection between coding theory and primitive words by some facts. We dene primitive words as words having only a trivial representation as the power of another word. Nonprimitive words (without the empty word) are exactly the periodic words. Every nonempty word is a power of an uniquely determined prim- itive word which is called the root of the former one. The set of all roots of nonempty words of a language is called the root of the language. The primitive words have interesting combinatorial properties which we con- sider in Section 2. In Section 3 we investigate the relationship between the set Q of all primitive words over some xed alphabet and the lan- guage classes of the Chomsky Hierarchy and the contextual languages over the same alphabet. The computational complexity of the set Q and of the roots of languages are considered in Section 4. The set of all pow- ers of the same degree of all words from a language is the power of this language. We examine the powers of languages for dierent sets of ex- ponents, and especially their regularity and context-freeness, in Section 5, and the decidability of appropriate questions in Section 6.

The theoretical results imply that this problem is highly intractable, e.g., synthesizing a system is 2EXPTIME-complete for an LTL specification and EXPTIME-complete for CTL. An argument in favor of synthesis is that the temporal specification is highly compact, and the complexity reflects the large size of the system constructed. A careful observation reveals that the size of the system is presented in such arguments as the size of its state space. This view is a bit biased, in the sense that the state space can be exponentially larger than the size of a reasonable implementation such as a circuit or a program. Although this alternative measure of the size of the synthesized system is more intuitive (e.g., this is the standard way model checking problems are measured), research on synthesis has so far stayed with measuring the system in terms of the explicit state space.

We first recall several methods of conversion from expressions to automata, enlightening the similarities between the words and trees cases. We then produce an original study of the power of enriched category theory applied 1) to automata and expressions implementation, and 2) to the study of associated algorithms, using advanced concepts of functional programming, while simultaneously constructing a Haskell implementation of notions of enriched category theory and associated automata. More precisely, the Haskell implementation and the algebraic definition of the generic automaton structure are based on the following ideas: - enriched categories, enriched functors, enriched monads, etc. can be implemented in Haskell; - Type level programming can be used to properly encode function arity; - monoids (word structure) and operads (tree structure) can be encoded as monoid objects; - tree and word automata can be represented by the same algebraic structure, via enriched categories. This generalization leads to surprising remarks.

Many solutions to this problem have been proposed, including restricting the type of weights used and employing a different valuation function that forces convergence. In this paper we describe an alternative approach that, rather than seeking to avoid the inevitable divergences, instead embraces them as a source of useful information. Specifically, rather than taking coefficients from an arbitrary semiring S we instead take them from S^N. Doing this is useful because it gives us information about how the weight of an infinite word does or does not diverge, and if it does diverge what form the divergence takes --- e.g., polynomial, exponential, etc. This approach has proved to be incredibly useful in the field of quantum simulation because when studying infinite systems, information about how quantities of interest, such as energy or magnetization, diverge is exactly what we want. \nIn this paper we introduce a new kind of automaton which we call a diverging automaton that maps infinite words to sequences of weights from a semiring and which employs a Buchi-like boundary condition. We then develop a theory for diverging power series and prove a Kleene Theorem connecting rational diverging power series to diverging automata. Afterward we repeat this process by introducing bidiverging automata which map biinfinite words to elements in S^(Z x N), developing a theory for bidiverging power series, and proving another Kleene Theorem.

Our method searches arbitrary regular expressions by matching multiple bytes in parallel using speculation. We partition the input string into chunks, match chunks in parallel, and combine the matching results. Our parallel matching algorithm exploits structural DFA properties to minimize the speculative overhead. Unlike previous approaches, our speculation is failure-free, i.e., (1) sequential semantics are maintained, and (2) speed-downs are avoided altogether. On architectures with a SIMD gather-operation for indexed memory loads, our matching operation is fully vectorized. The proposed load-balancing scheme uses an off-line profiling step to determine the matching capacity of each participating processor. Based on matching capacities, DFA matches are load-balanced on inhomogeneous parallel architectures such as cloud computing environments.

The expressive power of partially ordered automata is closely related to the expressivity of fragments of first-order logic on finite words or, equivalently, to the language classes of the levels of the Straubing-Th\\'erien hierarchy. Several fragments (levels) have been intensively investigated under various names. For instance, the fragment of first-order formulae with a single existential block of quantifiers in prenex normal form is known as piecewise testable languages or $J$-trivial languages. These languages are characterized by confluent partially ordered DFAs or by complete, confluent, and self-loop-deterministic partially ordered NFAs (ptNFAs for short). In this paper, we study the complexity of basic questions for several types of partially ordered automata on finite words; namely, the questions of inclusion, equivalence, and ($k$-)piecewise testability. The lower-bound complexity boils down to the complexity of universality. The universality problem asks whether a system recognizes all words over its alphabet. For ptNFAs, the complexity of universality decreases if the alphabet is fixed, but it is open if the alphabet may grow with the number of states. We show that deciding universality for general ptNFAs is as hard as for general NFAs. Our proof is a novel and nontrivial extension of our recent construction for self-loop-deterministic partially ordered NFAs, a model strictly more expressive than ptNFAs.

Acting as synchronous distributed algorithms, they use their input graph as a network in which identical processors communicate for a possibly infinite number of synchronous rounds. For the local variant of those automata, where the number of rounds is bounded by a constant, Hella et al. (2012, 2015) have established a logical characterization in terms of basic modal logic. In this thesis, we provide similar logical characterizations for two more expressive classes of distributed automata.The first class extends local automata with a global acceptance condition and the ability to alternate between non deterministic and parallel computations. We show that it is equivalent to monadic second-order logic on graphs. By restricting transitions to be non deterministic or deterministic, we also obtain two strictly weaker variants for which the emptiness problem is decidable.Our second class transfers the standard notion of asynchronous algorithm to the setting of non local distributed automata. There sulting machines are shown to be equivalent to a small fragment of least fixpoint logic, and more specifically, to a restricted variantof the modal \u03bc -calculus that allows least fixpoints but forbids greatest fixpoints. Exploiting the connection with logic, we additionally prove that the expressive power of those asynchronous automata is independent of whether or not messages can be lost.We then investigate the decidability of the emptiness problem forseveral classes of nonlocal automata. We show that the problem isundecidable in general, by simulating a Turing machine with adistributed automaton that exchanges the roles of space and time. Onthe other hand, the problem is found to be decidable in logspace for a class of forgetful automata, where the nodes see the messages received from their neighbors but cannot remember their own state.

However, there is a lack of methods for forecasting when a pattern might occur before such an occurrence is actually detected by a CER engine. We present a formal framework that attempts to address the issue of Complex Event Forecasting (CEF). Our framework combines two formalisms: a) symbolic automata which are used to encode complex event patterns; and b) prediction suffix trees which can provide a succinct probabilistic description of an automaton\u2019s behavior. We compare our proposed approach against state-of-the-art methods and show its advantage in terms of accuracy and efficiency. In particular, prediction suffix trees, being variable-order Markov models, have the ability to capture long-term dependencies in a stream by remembering only those past sequences that are informative enough. Our experimental results demonstrate the benefits, in terms of accuracy, of being able to capture such long-term dependencies. This is achieved by increasing the order of our model beyond what is possible with full-order Markov models that need to perform an exhaustive enumeration of all possible past sequences of a given order.

When the number of registers of both automata is fixed, we obtain a lower EXPTIME complexity, also improving the EXPSPACE upper bound from Mottet and Quaas for fixed number of registers. We reduce inclusion to universality, and then we reduce universality to the problem of counting the number of orbits of runs of the automaton. We show that the orbit-counting function satisfies a system of bidimensional linear recursive equations with polynomial coefficients (linrec), which generalises analogous recurrences for the Stirling numbers of the second kind, and then we show that universality reduces to the zeroness problem for linrec sequences. While such a counting approach is classical and has successfully been applied to unambiguous finite automata and grammars over finite alphabets, its application to register automata over infinite alphabets is novel. We provide two algorithms to decide the zeroness problem for bidimensional linear recursive sequences arising from orbit-counting functions. Both algorithms rely on techniques from linear non-commutative algebra. The first algorithm performs variable elimination and has elementary complexity. The second algorithm is a refined version of the first one and it relies on the computation of the Hermite normal form of matrices over a skew polynomial field.

In a breakthrough result Calude, Jain, Khoussainov, Li, and Stephan constructed in 2017 a quasipolynomial time algorithm for solving parity games, which was quickly followed by two other algorithms with the same complexity. Our objective is to investigate how these techniques can be extended to the study of mean payoff games. The starting point is the notion of separating automata, which has been used to present all three quasipolynomial time algorithms for parity games and gives the best complexity to date. The notion naturally extends to mean payoff games and yields a class of algorithms for solving mean payoff games. The contribution of this paper is to prove tight bounds on the complexity of algorithms in this class. We construct two new algorithms for solving mean payoff games. Our first algorithm depends on the largest weight $N$ (in absolute value) appearing in the graph and runs in sublinear time in $N$, improving over the previously known linear dependence in $N$. Our second algorithm runs in polynomial time for a fixed number $k$ of weights. We complement our upper bounds by providing in both cases almost matching lower bounds, showing the limitations of the separating automata approach.

However, since their elements are infinite words, not every omega-regular language can sensibly be monitored at runtime when only a finite prefix of a word, modelling the observed system behaviour so far, is available. The monitorability of an omega-regular language, L, is thus a property that holds, if for any finite word u, observed so far, it is possible to add another finite word v, such that uv becomes a \"finite witness\" wrt. L; that is, for any infinite word w, we have that uvw \\in L, or for any infinite word w, we have that uvw \\not\\in L. This notion has been studied in the past by several authors, and it is known that the class of monitorable languages is strictly more expressive than, e.g., the commonly used class of so-called safety languages. But an exact categorisation of monitorable languages has, so far, been missing. Motivated by the use of linear-time temporal logic (LTL) in many approaches to runtime verification, this paper first determines the complexity of the monitorability problem when L is given by an LTL formula. Further, it then shows that this result, in fact, transfers to omega-regular languages in general, i.e., whether they are given by an LTL formula, a nondeterministic Buechi automaton, or even by an omega-regular expression.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Andreas  Bauer"], "year": 2010, "n_citations": 11}

Fresh-register automata extend register automata with the capability to generate fresh symbols in order to model computational scenarios involving name creation. This paper investigates the complexity of the bisimilarity problem for classes of register and fresh-register automata. We examine all main disciplines that have appeared in the literature: general register assignments, assignments where duplicate register values are disallowed, and assignments without duplicates in which registers cannot be empty. In the general case, we show that the problem is EXPTIME-complete. However, the absence of duplicate values in registers enables us to identify inherent symmetries inside the associated bisimulation relations, which can be used to establish a polynomial bound on the depth of Attacker-winning strategies. Furthermore, they enable a highly succinct representation of the corresponding bisimulations. By exploiting results from group theory and computational group theory, we can then show solvability in PSPACE and NP respectively for the latter two register disciplines. In each case, we find that freshness does not affect the complexity class of the problem. The results allow us to close a complexity gap for language equivalence of deterministic register automata. We show that deterministic language in equivalence for the no-duplicates fragment is NP-complete, which disproves an old conjecture of Sakamoto.

Since state complexity is a property of a language, it is appropriate to define it in formal-language terms as the number of distinct quotients of the language, and to call it \"quotient complexity\". The problem of finding the quotient complexity of a language f(K,L) is considered, where K and L are regular languages and f is a regular operation, for example, union or concatenation. Since quotients can be represented by derivatives, one can find a formula for the typical quotient of f(K,L) in terms of the quotients of K and L. To obtain an upper bound on the number of quotients of f(K,L) all one has to do is count how many such quotients are possible, and this makes automaton constructions unnecessary. The advantages of this point of view are illustrated by many examples. Moreover, new general observations are presented to help in the estimation of the upper bounds on quotient complexity of regular operations.", "venue": "DCFS", "authors": ["Janusz  Brzozowski"], "year": 2009, "n_citations": 61}

In this technical report we introduce a unified representation framework that enables the identifica- tion of process constraints from domain rules and their later unification within a process constraint base.

The question is formalized using valence automata, an abstract model of automata in which the storage mechanism is given by a monoid. For each of a variety of storage mechanisms, one can choose a (typically infinite) monoid $M$ such that valence automata over $M$ are equivalent to (one-way) automata with this type of storage. In fact, many important storage mechanisms can be realized by monoids defined by finite graphs, called graph monoids. Examples include pushdown stacks, partially blind counters (which behave like Petri net places), blind counters (which may attain negative values), and combinations thereof. \nHence, we study for which graph monoids the emptiness problem for valence automata is decidable. A particular model realized by graph monoids is that of Petri nets with a pushdown stack. For these, decidability is a long-standing open question and we do not answer it here. \nHowever, if one excludes subgraphs corresponding to this model, a characterization can be achieved. Moreover, we provide a description of those storage mechanisms for which decidability remains open. This leads to a model that naturally generalizes both pushdown Petri nets and the priority multicounter machines introduced by Reinhardt. \nThe cases that are proven decidable constitute a natural and apparently new extension of Petri nets with decidable reachability.

Several new results ensue from this methodology: uncovering of dynamical modularity (modules in the dynamics rather than in the structure of networks), identification of minimal conditions and critical nodes to control the convergence to attractors, simulation of dynamical behaviour from incomplete information about initial conditions, and measures of macro-level canalization and robustness to perturbations. We exemplify our methodology with a well-known model of the intra- and inter cellular genetic regulation of body segmentation in Drosophila melanogaster.

Interestingly, this framework is much richer than term rewriting systems and requires the elaboration of a new theoretical framework for representing critical pairs, based on contexts in compact 2-categories.", "venue": "RTA", "authors": ["Samuel  Mimram"], "year": 2010, "n_citations": 24}

Linear temporal logic (LTL) is used to specify high-level tasks over infinite horizon, which can be converted into a limit deterministic generalized B\u00fcchi automaton (LDGBA) with several accepting sets. The novelty is to design an embedded product MDP (EP-MDP) between the LDGBA and the MDP by incorporating a synchronous tracking-frontier function to record unvisited accepting sets of the automaton, and to facilitate the satisfaction of the accepting conditions. The proposed LDGBA-based reward shaping and discounting schemes for the model-free reinforcement learning (RL) only depend on the EP-MDP states and can overcome the issues of sparse rewards. Rigorous analysis shows that any RL method that optimizes the expected discounted return is guaranteed to find an optimal policy whose traces maximize the satisfaction probability. A modular deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) is then developed to generate such policies over continuous state and action spaces.

A deceptive defender can allocate decoys, in addition to defense actions, to create disinformation for the attacker. Thus, we focus on the problem of jointly synthesizing a decoy placement strategy and a deceptive defense strategy that maximally exploits the incomplete information the attacker about the decoy locations. We introduce a model of hypergames on graphs with temporal logic objectives to capture such adversarial interactions with asymmetric information. Using the hypergame model, we analyze the effectiveness of a given decoy placement, quantified by the set of deceptive winning states where the defender can prevent the attacker from satisfying the attack objective given its incomplete information about decoy locations. Then, we investigate how to place decoys to maximize the defender's deceptive winning region. Considering the large search space for all possible decoy allocation strategies, we incorporate the idea of compositional synthesis from formal methods and show that the objective function in the class of decoy allocation problem is monotone and non-decreasing. We derive the sufficient conditions under which the objective function for the decoy allocation problem is submodular, or supermodular, respectively.

Despite years of efforts, there are no known truly sub-cubic algorithms for this problem. We study the related certification task: given an instance of CFL reachability, are there small and efficiently checkable certificates for the existence and for the non-existence of a path? We show that, in both scenarios, there exist succinct certificates (O(n2) in the size of the problem) and these certificates can be checked in subcubic (matrix multiplication) time. The certificates are based on grammar-based compression of paths (for positive instances) and on invariants represented as matrix constraints (for negative instances). Thus, CFL reachability lies in nondeterministic and co-nondeterministic subcubic time. A natural question is whether faster algorithms for CFL reachability will lead to faster algorithms for combinatorial problems such as Boolean satisfiability (SAT). As a consequence of our certification results, we show that there cannot be a finegrained reduction from SAT to CFL reachability for a conditional lower bound stronger than n, unless the nondeterministic strong exponential time hypothesis (NSETH) fails. Our results extend to related subcubic equivalent problems: pushdown reachability and two-way nondeterministic pushdown automata (2NPDA) language recognition. For example, we describe succinct certificates for pushdown non-reachability (inductive invariants) and observe that they can be checked in matrix multiplication time.

In this paper, we propose a new technique for synthesizing hybrid automaton from the input-output traces of a non-linear cyberphysical system. Similarity detection in non-linear behaviors is the main challenge for extracting such models. We address this problem by utilizing the Dynamic Time Warping technique. Our approach is passive, meaning that it does not need interaction with the system during automata synthesis from the logged traces; and online, which means that each input/output trace is used only once in the procedure. In other words, each new trace can be used to improve the already synthesized automaton. We evaluated our algorithm in two industrial and simulated case studies.

In this paper, we consider another type of repetition, called pseudopower, inspired by the Watson-Crick complementarity property of DNA sequences. A DNA single strand can be viewed as a string over the four-letter alphabet {A,C,G, T}, wherein A is the complement of T, while C is the complement of G. Such a DNA single strand will bind to a reverse complement DNA single strand, called its Watson-Crick complement, to form a helical double-stranded DNA molecule. The Watson-Crick complement of a DNA strand is deducible from, and thus informationally equivalent to, the original strand. We use this fact to generalize the notion of the power of a word by relaxing the meaning of \u201csameness\u201d to include the image through an antimorphic involution, the model of DNA Watson-Crick complementarity. Given a finite alphabet \u03a3, an antimorphic involution is a function t : \u03a3a \u2192 \u03a3a which is an involution, i.e., t2 equals the identity, and an antimorphism, i.e., t(uv) = t(v)t(u), for all u \u2208 \u03a3a.

The classical kth-power of a word is a special case of a pseudo-kth-power, where all the repeating units are identical.

As such, after each marking step, the word can be seen as a sequence of blocks of marked letters separated by blocks of non-marked letters. By keeping track of the evolution of the marked blocks of the word through the marking defined by a marking sequence, one defines the blocksequence of the respective marking sequence. We first show that the words sharing the same blocksequence are only loosely connected, so we consider the stronger notion of extended blocksequence, which stores additional information on the form of each single marked block. In this context, we present a series of combinatorial results for words sharing the extended blocksequence.", "venue": "SOFSEM", "authors": ["Pamela  Fleischmann", "Lukas  Haschke", "Florin  Manea", "Dirk  Nowotka", "Cedric Tsatia Tsida", "Judith  Wiedenbeck"], "year": 2021, "n_citations": 0}

We investigate the corresponding enumeration problem, that is, given a graph and an RPQ, enumerate all paths in the graph that match the RPQ. We consider several versions of this problem, corresponding to different semantics of RPQs that have recently been considered: arbitrary paths, shortest paths, simple paths, and trails. Whereas arbitrary and shortest paths can be enumerated in polynomial delay, the situation is much more intricate for simple paths and trails. For instance, already the question if a given graph contains a simple path or trail of a certain length has cases with highly non-trivial solutions and cases that are long-standing open problems. In this setting, we study RPQ evaluation from a parameterized complexity perspective. We define a class of simple transitive expressions that is prominent in practice and for which we can prove two dichotomy-like results: one for simple paths and one for trails paths. We observe that, even though simple path semantics and trail semantics are intractable for RPQs in general, they are feasible for the vast majority of the kinds of RPQs that users use in practice. At the heart of this study is a result of independent interest on the parameterized complexity of finding disjoint paths in graphs: the two disjoint paths problem is W[1]-hard if parameterized by the length of one of the two paths.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Wim  Martens", "Tina  Trautner"], "year": 2017, "n_citations": 6}

Only a handful of power series of finite order (forcedly a power of 2) are explicitly known through a formula for their coefficients. We argue in this paper that it is advantageous to describe such series in closed computational form through automata, based on effective versions of proofs of Christol\u2019s theorem identifying algebraic and automatic series. Up to conjugation, there are only finitely many series \u03c3 of order 2 with fixed break sequence (i.e. the sequence of depths of \u03c3\u25e62 i ). Starting from Witt vector or Carlitz module constructions, we give an explicit automaton-theoretic description of: (a) representatives up to conjugation for all series of order 4 with break sequence (1,m) for m < 10; (b) representatives up to conjugation for all series of order 8 with minimal break sequence (1, 3, 11); and (c) an embedding of the Klein four-group into the Nottingham group at 2. We study the complexity of the new examples from the algebro-geometric properties of the equations they satisfy. For this, we generalise the theory of sparseness of power series to a four-step hierarchy of complexity, for which we give both Galois-theoretic and combinatorial descriptions. We identify where our different series fit into this hierarchy. We construct sparse representatives for the conjugacy class of elements of order two and depth 2\u00b11 (\u03bc > 1). Series with small state complexity can end up high in the hierarchy. This is true, for example, for a new automaton we found, representing a series of order 4 with 5 states (the minimal possible number for such a series).", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Jakub  Byszewski", "Gunther  Cornelissen", "Djurre  Tijsma"], "year": 2020, "n_citations": 1}

This is a serious obstacle for the development of algorithms, because basic constructions, such as learning algorithms, cannot be applied. In this paper, we present a canonical representation for the widely used class of regular k-safety hyperproperties, which includes important polices such as noninterference. We show that a regular k-safety hyperproperty S can be represented by a finite automaton, where each word accepted by the automaton represents a violation of S. The representation provides an automata-theoretic approach to regular k-safety hyperproperties and allows us to compare regular k-safety hyperproperties, simplify them, and learn such hyperproperties. We investigate the problem of constructing automata for regular k-safety hyperproperties in general and from formulas in HyperLTL, and provide complexity bounds for the different translations.

The notion of computability is defined through Turing machines with infinite inputs which can produce the corresponding infinite outputs in the limit. We use non-deterministic transducers equipped with registers, an extension of register automata with outputs, to describe specifications. Being nondeterministic, such transducers may not define functions but more generally relations of data \u03c9-words. In order to increase the expressive power of these machines, we even allow guessing of arbitrary data values when updating their registers. For functions over data \u03c9-words, we identify a sufficient condition (the possibility of determining the next letter to be outputted, which we call next letter problem) under which computability (resp. uniform computability) and continuity (resp. uniform continuity) coincide. We focus on two kinds of data domains: first, the general setting of oligomorphic data, which encompasses any data domain with equality, as well as the setting of rational numbers with linear order; and second, the set of natural numbers equipped with linear order. For both settings, we prove that functionality, i.e. determining whether the relation recognized by the transducer is actually a function, is decidable. We also show that the socalled next letter problem is decidable, yielding equivalence between (uniform) continuity and (uniform) computability.

Conformance checking techniques asses the suitability of a process model in representing an underlying process, observed through a collection of real executions. One important metric in conformance checking is to asses the precision of the model with respect to the observed executions, i.e., characterize the ability of the model to produce behavior unrelated to the one observed.

Getting a minimal automaton is a fundamental issue in the use and implementation of finite automata tools in frameworks like text processing, image analysis, linguistic computer science, and many other applications. There are two main families of minimization algorithms. The first by a sequence of refinements of a partition of the set of states, the second by a sequence of fusions or merges of states. Hopcroft's and Moore's algorithms belong to the first family, the linear-time minimization of acyclic automata of Revuz belongs to the second family. \nOne of our studies is upon the comparison of the nature of Moore's and Hopcroft's algorithms. This gives some new insight in both algorithms. As we shall see, these algorithms are quite different both in behavior and in complexity. In particular, we show that it is not possible to simulate the computations of one of the algorithm by the other. We describe the minimization algorithm by fusion for so-called local automata.

The idea is to iterate a dynamical system where the output of an OCA pair is fed back as a new set of coordinates on the superposed squares. The main advantage is that OCA ensure a certain amount of diffusion in the generated sequences, a property which is usually missing from traditional CA-based pseudorandom number generators. We study the problem of finding OCA pairs with maximal period by first performing an exhaustive search over local rules of diameter up to $\\mathbf{d=5}$, and then focusing on the subclass of linear bipermutive rules. In this case, we characterize an upper bound on the periods of the sequences in terms of the order of the subgroup generated by an invertible Sylvester matrix. We finally devise an algorithm based on Lagrange's theorem to efficiently enumerate all linear OCA pairs that induce Sylvester matrices of maximal order up to diameter $d=11$,", "venue": "2021 Ninth International Symposium on Computing and Networking (CANDAR)", "authors": ["Luca  Mariot"], "year": 2021, "n_citations": 1}

It is known that there are only three possibilities for the cardinality of the complement of an omega-language $L(A)$ accepted by a Buchi 1-counter automaton $A$. We prove the following surprising result: there exists a 1-counter Buchi automaton $A$ such that the cardinality of the complement $L(A)^-$ of the omega-language $L(A)$ is not determined by ZFC: (1). There is a model $V_1$ of ZFC in which $L(A)^-$ is countable. (2). There is a model $V_2$ of ZFC in which $L(A)^-$ has cardinal $2^{\\aleph_0}$. (3). There is a model $V_3$ of ZFC in which $L(A)^-$ has cardinal $\\aleph_1$ with $\\aleph_0<\\aleph_1<2^{\\aleph_0}$. We prove a very similar result for the complement of an infinitary rational relation accepted by a 2-tape Buchi automaton $B$. As a corollary, this proves that the Continuum Hypothesis may be not satisfied for complements of 1-counter omega-languages and for complements of infinitary rational relations accepted by 2-tape Buchi automata. We infer from the proof of the above results that basic decision problems about 1-counter omega-languages or infinitary rational relations are actually located at the third level of the analytical hierarchy. In particular, the problem to determine whether the complement of a 1-counter omega-language (respectively, infinitary rational relation) is countable is in $\\Sigma_3^1 \\setminus (\\Pi_2^1 \\cup \\Sigma_2^1)$. This is rather surprising if compared to the fact that it is decidable whether an infinitary rational relation is countable (respectively, uncountable).", "venue": "RAIRO Theor.

For reasoning about graphs that are expressible by regular expressions it is desirable to have structural representations of process graphs in the image of the interpretation. For \u20181-free\u2019 regular expressions, their process interpretations satisfy the structural property LEE (loop existence and elimination).

In theory, the claim is well founded in the fact that many biologically relevant interactions between residues of protein sequences have a character of nested or crossed dependencies. In practice, there is hardly any evidence that grammars of higher expressiveness have an edge over old good HMMs in typical applications including recognition and classification of protein sequences. This is in contrast to RNA modeling, where CFG power some of the most successful tools. There have been proposed several explanations of this phenomenon. On the biology side, one difficulty is that interactions in proteins are often less specific and more \"collective\" in comparison to RNA. On the modeling side, a difficulty is the larger alphabet which combined with high complexity of CF and CS grammars imposes considerable trade-offs consisting on information reduction or learning sub-optimal solutions. Indeed, some studies hinted that CF level of expressiveness brought an added value in protein modeling when CF and regular grammars where implemented in the same framework. However, there have been no systematic study of explanatory power provided by various grammatical models. The first step to this goal is define objective criteria of such evaluation. Intuitively, a decent explanatory grammar should generate topology, or the parse tree, consistent with topology of the protein, or its secondary and/or tertiary structure. In this piece of research we build on this intuition and propose a set of measures to compare topology of the parse tree of a grammar with topology of the protein structure.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Witold  Dyrka", "Fran\u00e7ois  Coste", "Olgierd  Unold", "Lukasz  Culer", "Agnieszka  Kaczmarek"], "year": 2016, "n_citations": 0}

These tools reflect the distributed nature of traces and the underlying causality and concurrency between events, and can be said to support true concurrency. They generalize the tools that have been so efficient in understanding, classifying and reasoning about word languages. In particular, we introduce an asynchronous version of the wreath product operation and we describe the trace languages recognized by such products (the so-called asynchronous wreath product principle). We then propose a decomposition result for recognizable trace languages, analogous to the Krohn-Rhodes theorem, and we prove this decomposition result in the special case of acyclic architectures. Finally, we introduce and analyze two distributed automata-theoretic operations. One, the local cascade product, is a direct implementation of the asynchronous wreath product operation. The other, global cascade sequences, although conceptually and operationally similar to the local cascade product, translates to a more complex asynchronous implementation which uses the gossip automaton of Mukund and Sohoni. This leads to interesting applications to the characterization of trace languages definable in first-order logic: they are accepted by a restricted local cascade product of the gossip automaton and 2-state asynchronous reset automata, and also by a global cascade sequence of 2-state asynchronous reset automata. Over distributed alphabets for which the asynchronous Krohn-Rhodes theorem holds, a local cascade product of such automata is sufficient and this, in turn, leads to the identification of a simple temporal logic which is expressively complete for such alphabets.

They have recently been fruitfully explored in understanding minimisation of various types of automata. In Bezhanishvili et al. (2012), a dual equivalence between a category of coalgebras and a category of algebras was used to explain minimisation. The algebraic semantics is dual to a coalgebraic semantics in which logical equivalence coincides with trace equivalence. It follows that maximal quotients of coalgebras correspond to minimal subobjects of algebras. Examples include partially observable deterministic finite automata, linear weighted automata viewed as coalgebras over finite-dimensional vector spaces, and belief automata, which are coalgebras on compact Hausdorff spaces. In Bonchi et al. (2014), Brzozowski's double-reversal minimisation algorithm for deterministic finite automata was described categorically and its correctness explained via the duality between reachability and observability. This work includes generalisations of Brzozowski's algorithm to Moore and weighted automata over commutative semirings. \nIn this paper we propose a general categorical framework within which such minimisation algorithms can be understood. The goal is to provide a unifying perspective based on duality. Our framework consists of a stack of three interconnected adjunctions: a base dual adjunction that can be lifted to a dual adjunction between coalgebras and algebras and also to a dual adjunction between automata.

This is nontrivial since standard encodings of symbols in, e.g., binary can turn self-loops into longer cycles. A lower coNP -complete complexity bound is obtained if all self-loops in the poNFA are deterministic. We find that such restricted poNFAs (rpoNFAs) characterize R -trivial languages, and establish the complexity of deciding if the language of an NFA is R -trivial. The limitation to fixed alphabets is essential even in the restricted case: deciding universality of rpoNFAs with unbounded alphabets is PSpace -complete.

The classification of cancer progression using discrete states like stages and hallmarks has become common in the biology literature, but primarily as an organizing principle, and not as an executable formalism. The precise computational model developed here aims to exploit this untapped potential, namely, through automatic verification of progression models (e.g., consistency, causal connections, etc.), classification of unreachable or unstable states and computer-generated (individualized or universal) therapy plans. The paper builds on a phenomenological approach, and as such does not need to assume a model for the biochemistry of the underlying natural progression. Rather, it abstractly models transition timings between states as well as the effects of drugs and clinical tests, and thus allows formalization of temporal statements about the progression as well as notions of timed therapies. The model proposed here is ultimately based on hybrid automata, and we show how existing controller synthesis algorithms can be generalized to CHA models, so that therapies can be generated automatically. Throughout this paper we use cancer hallmarks to represent the discrete states through which cancer progresses, but other notions of discretely or continuously varying state formalisms could also be used to derive similar therapies.", "venue": "HSB", "authors": ["Loes Olde Loohuis", "Andreas  Witzel", "Bud  Mishra"], "year": 2012, "n_citations": 4}

Due to the dynamic nature of the surrounding world of these systems, assuring the satisfaction of their properties at runtime and in the presence of a change is important. A prominent approach to assure the correct behavior of these systems is verification at runtime, which has strict time and memory limitations. To tackle these limitations, we propose Magnifier, an iterative, incremental, and compositional verification approach that operates on a component-based model. The Magnifier idea is zooming on the component affected by a change, verifying the correctness of properties of interest of the system after adapting the component to the change, and then zooming out and tracing the change if it propagates. If the change propagates, all components affected by the change are adapted and are composed to form a new component. Magnifier repeats the same process for the new component. This iterative process terminates whenever the propagation of the change stops. In Magnifier, we use the Coordinated Adaptive Actor model (CoodAA) of traffic control systems. We present a formal semantics for CoodAA as a network of Timed Input-Output Automata (TIOAs). The change does not propagate if TIOAs of the adapted component and its environment are compatible.

Such processes generally rely on formal methods, which can guarantee, thanks to their mathematical foundation, model preciseness, and properties assurance.

In this paper, we report our experience in using the State Machine formal method and the ASMETA framework in developing a prototype of the control software of the MVM (Mechanical Ventilator Milano), a mechanical lung ventilator that has been designed, successfully certified, and deployed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to time constraints and lack of skills, no formal method was applied for the MVM project. However, we here want to assess the feasibility of developing (part of) the ventilator by using a formal method-based approach. Our development process starts from a high-level formal specification of the system to describe the MVM main operation modes. Then, through a sequence of refined models, all the other requirements are captured, up to a level in which a C++ implementation of a prototype of the MVM controller is automatically generated from the model, and tested. Along the process, at each refinement level, different model validation and verification activities are performed, and each refined model is proved to be a correct refinement of the previous level.

Concerning the fundamental analysis problem of comparing a candidate implementation against a specification, both given as TA, it has been shown that timed trace equivalence is undecidable, whereas timed bisimulation equivalence is decidable. The corresponding proof utilizes region graphs, a finite, but very space-consuming characterization of TA semantics. In practice, most TA tools use zone graphs instead, a symbolic and generally more efficient representation of TA semantics, to automate analysis tasks. However, zone graphs only produce sound results for analysis tasks being reducible to plain reachability problems thus being too imprecise for checking timed bisimilarity. Hence, to the best of our knowledge, no practical tool is currently available for automated timed bisimilarity-checking. In this paper, we propose bounded zone-history graphs, a novel characterization of TA semantics facilitating an adjustable trade-off between precision and scalability of timed-bisimilarity checking.

We qualify this implication by proving that self-attention networks can process Dyckk,D, the subset of Dyckk with depth bounded by D, which arguably better captures the bounded hierarchical structure of natural language. Specifically, we construct a hard-attention network with D + 1 layers and O(log k) memory size (per token per layer) that recognizes Dyckk,D, and a soft-attention network with two layers and O(log k) memory size that generates Dyckk,D.

In an effort to understand its dynamics, and since Generalised Collatz Maps are known to simulate Turing Machines [Conway, 1972], it seems natural to ask what kinds of algorithmic behaviours it embeds. We define a quasi-cellular automaton that exactly simulates the Collatz process on the square grid: on input $x\\in\\mathbb{N}$, written horizontally in base 2, successive rows give the Collatz sequence of $x$ in base 2. We show that vertical columns simultaneously iterate the map in base 3. This leads to our main result: the Collatz process embeds an algorithm that converts any natural number from base 3 to base 2. We also find that the evolution of our automaton computes the parity of the number of 1s in any ternary input. It follows that predicting about half of the bits of the iterates $T^i(x)$, for $i = O(\\log x)$, is in the complexity class NC$^1$ but outside AC$^0$. Finally, we show that in the extension of the Collatz process to numbers with infinite binary expansions ($2$-adic integers) [Lagarias, 1985], our automaton encodes the cyclic Collatz conjecture as a natural reachability problem.

However, state-space explosion is an intrinsic problem which limits the applicability of model checking tools. To overcome this limitation software model checkers have suggested different approaches, among which abstraction methods have been highly esteemed. modern techniques. Among others, predicate abstraction is a prominent technique which has been widely used in modern model checking. This technique has been shown to enhance the effectiveness of the reachability computation technique in infinite-state systems. In this te chnique an infinite-state system is represented abstractly by a finite-state system, where states of the abst ract model correspond to the truth valuations of a chosen set of atomic predicates. Predicate abstraction was first introduced in (8) as a method for auto- matically determining invariant properties of infinite-st ate systems. This technique involves abstracting a concrete transition system using a set of formulas called predicates which usually denote some state properties of the concrete system. The practical applicability of predicate abstraction is im peded by two problems. First, predicates need to be provided manually (11, 7). This means that the selection of appropriate abstraction predicates is based on a user-driven trial-and-error process. The high degree of user intervention also stands in the way of a seamless integration into practical software development processes. Second, very often the abstraction is too coarse in order to allow relevant system properties to be verified. This calls for abstrac- tion refinement (6), often following a counterexample guide d abstraction refinement scheme (5, 3). Real time models are one example of systems with a large state space as time adds much complexity to the system. In this event, recently there have been increasing number of research to provide a means for the abstraction of such models. It is the objective of this paper to provide support for an automated predicate abstraction technique for concurrent dense real-time models according to the timed automaton model of (1). We propose a method to generate an efficient set of pred icates than a manual, ad-hoc process would be able to provide. We use the results from our recent work (2) to analyze the behavior of the system under verification to discover its local state invari ants and to remove transitions that can never be traversed. We then describe a method to compute a predicate abstraction based on these state invariants. We use information regarding the control state labels as well as the newly computed invariants in the considered control states when determining the abstraction predicates.

When restricted to the appropriate families of graphs, these forgetful automata are equivalent to classical finite word automata, but strictly more expressive than finite tree automata.

The (global) state reachability problem for DCPS is undecidable in general, but Atig et al. (2009) showed that it becomes decidable, and is in 2EXPSPACE, when each thread is restricted to a fixed number of context switches. The best known lower bound for the problem is EXPSPACE-hard and this lower bound follows already when each thread is a finite-state machine and runs atomically to completion (i.e., does not switch contexts). In this paper, we close the gap by showing that state reachability is 2EXPSPACE-hard already with only one context switch. Interestingly, state reachability analysis is in EXPSPACE both for pushdown threads without context switches as well as for finite-state threads with arbitrary context switches. Thus, recursive threads together with a single context switch provide an exponential advantage. \nOur proof techniques are of independent interest for 2EXPSPACE-hardness results.

A notorious one is controller synthesis, which can be rephrased through the game-theoretic metaphor as the quest for a winning strategy of the system in a game against its antagonistic environment. Depending on the specification, optimal strategies might be simple or quite complex, for example having to use (possibly infinite) memory. Hence, research strives to understand which settings allow for simple strategies. \nIn 2005, Gimbert and Zielonka provided a complete characterization of preference relations (a formal framework to model specifications and game objectives) that admit memoryless optimal strategies for both players. In the last fifteen years however, practical applications have driven the community toward games with complex or multiple objectives, where memory -- finite or infinite -- is almost always required. Despite much effort, the exact frontiers of the class of preference relations that admit finite-memory optimal strategies still elude us. \nIn this work, we establish a complete characterization of preference relations that admit optimal strategies using arena-independent finite memory, generalizing the work of Gimbert and Zielonka to the finite-memory case. We also prove an equivalent to their celebrated corollary of great practical interest: if both players have optimal (arena-independent-)finite-memory strategies in all one-player games, then it is also the case in all two-player games. Finally, we pinpoint the boundaries of our results with regard to the literature: our work completely covers the case of arena-independent memory (e.g., multiple parity objectives, lower- and upper-bounded energy objectives), and paves the way to the arena-dependent case (e.g., multiple lower-bounded energy objectives).", "venue": "CONCUR", "authors": ["Patricia  Bouyer", "St\u00e9phane Le Roux", "Youssouf  Oualhadj", "Mickael  Randour", "Pierre  Vandenhove"], "year": 2020, "n_citations": 6}

It is traditionally used in various program logics for expressing the correctness properties and certificates. Although such representations are expressive for some theories, they fail to express many interesting properties of algebraic data types (ADTs). In this paper, we explore three different approaches to represent program invariants of ADT-manipulating programs: tree automata, and first-order formulas with or without size constraints. We compare the expressive power of these representations and prove the negative definability of both first-order representations using the pumping lemmas. We present an approach to automatically infer program invariants of ADT-manipulating programs by a reduction to a finite model finder. The implementation called RInGen has been evaluated against state-of-the-art invariant synthesizers and has been experimentally shown to be competitive. In particular, program invariants represented by automata are capable of expressing more complex properties of computation and their automatic construction is often less expensive.", "venue": "PLDI", "authors": ["Yurii  Kostyukov", "Dmitry  Mordvinov", "Grigory  Fedyukovich"], "year": 2021, "n_citations": 3}

More precisely, the complexity of RPQ evaluation divides the regular languages into the finite languages, the class Ttract (for which the problem is tractable), and the rest.

To explain observed self-organization of systems by emergy the Maximum Empower Principle (MEP) was proposed initially without a mathematical formulation. \nEmergy analysis is based on four rules called emergy algebra. Most of emergy computations in steady state are in fact approximate results, which rely on linear algebra. In such a context, a mathematical formulation of the MEP has been proposed by Giannantoni (2002). \nIn 2012 Le Corre and the second author of this paper have proposed a rigorous mathematical framework for emergy analysis.

In this paper the MEP in steady state is formalized in the context of the max-plus algebra and graph theory. The main concepts of the paper are (a) a particular graph called 'emergy graph', (b) the notion of compatible paths of the emergy graph, and (c) sets of compatible paths, which are called 'emergy states'.

First we define the dual set, of initial configurations from which a non-terminating execution exists, as the greatest fixpoint of the function that maps a set of states into its pre-image with respect to the transition relation. This definition allows to compute the weakest non-termination precondition if at least one of the following holds: (i) the transition relation is deterministic, (ii) the descending Kleene sequence over-approximating the greatest fixpoint converges in finitely many steps, or (iii) the transition relation is well founded. We show that this is the case for two classes of relations, namely octagonal and finite monoid affine relations. Moreover, since the closed forms of these relations can be defined in Presburger arithmetic, we obtain the decidability of the termination problem for such loops. We show that the weakest non-termination precondition for octagonal relations can be computed in time polynomial in the size of the binary representation of the relation. Furthermore, for every well-founded octagonal relation, we prove the existence of an effectively computable well-founded witness relation for which a linear ranking function exists. For the class of linear affine relations we show that the weakest non-termination precondition can be defined in Presburger arithmetic if the relation has the finite monoid property. Otherwise, for a more general subclass, called polynomially bounded affine relations, we give a method of under-approximating the termination preconditions. Finally, we apply the method of computing weakest non-termination preconditions for conjunctive relations (octagonal or affine) to computing termination preconditions for programs with complex transition relations. We provide algorithms for computing transition invariants and termination preconditions, and define a class of programs, whose control structure has no nested loops, for which these algorithms provide precise results.

This is particularly important for distributed systems with shared resources, e.g., one case can block another case competing for the same machine, leading to inter-case dependencies in performance. However, due to a variety of reasons, real-life systems often record only a subset of all events taking place. To understand and analyze the behavior and performance of processes with shared resources, we aim to reconstruct bounds for timestamps of events in a case that must have happened but were not recorded by inference over events in other cases in the system. We formulate and solve the problem by systematically introducing multi-entity concepts in event logs and process models. We introduce a partial-order based model of a multi-entity event log and a corresponding compositional model for multientity processes. We define PQR-systems as a special class of multi-entity processes with shared resources and queues. We then study the problem of inferring from an incomplete event log unobserved events and their timestamps that are globally consistent with a PQR-system. We solve the problem by reconstructing unobserved traces of resources and queues according to the PQR-model and derive bounds for their timestamps using a linear program.

However, we show that these two machine models are not independent: if there exists a polynomial trade-off for the classical two-way automata, then there must also exist a polynomial trade-off for the pebble two-way automata. Thus, we have an upward collapse (or a downward separation) from the classical two-way automata to more powerful pebble automata, still staying within the class of regular languages.

Utterance verification in this work implies the ability to determine when portions of a hypothesized word string correspond to incorrectly decoded vocabulary words or out-of-vocabulary words that may appear in an utterance. This capability is implemented here as a likelihood ratio (LR). There are two UV techniques that are presented here. The first is voice verification along with the vocabulary testing, at the same time the parameters for UV models are generated based on the optimization criterion which is directly related to the LR measure. The second technique is a pitch recognition based on weighted finite-state transducers. These transducers provide a common and natural representation for major components of speech recognition systems, including hidden Markov models (HMMs), context-dependency models, pronunciation dictionaries, statistical grammars, and word or phone lattices. The finite state machine processes the acoustic parameters of UV models. The results of an experimental study presented in the paper shows that LR based parameter estimation results in a significant improvement in UV performance for this task. The study also found that the use of the LR based weighted finite-state transducers along with the UV, can provide as much as an 11% improvement in UV performance when compared to existing UV procedures. Finally, it was also found that the performance of the finite state machine was highly dependent on the use of the LR criterion in training acoustic models.

We compare and contrast the artificial language examples with natural languages (using Welsh, a language where the 'noun' type cannot be taken as primitive, as an illustrative example). \nThe hypothesis is simply that there must exist a causal connection, or information flow, between the words of a sentence in a language whose purpose is to communicate information. This is not necessarily the case with formal languages that are simply generated by a series of 'meaning-free' rules. This imposes restrictions on the types of pregroup grammars that we expect to find in natural languages; we formalize this in algebraic, categorical, and graphical terms. \nWe take some preliminary steps in providing conditions that ensure pregroup models satisfy these conjectured properties, and discuss the more general forms this hypothesis may take.", "venue": "CAPNS@QI", "authors": ["Peter M.

By modeling independently the distributions of the conserved columns from an underlying multiple sequence alignment of the proteins, these models are unable to capture dependencies between the protein residues. Non-local interactions can be represented by using more expressive grammatical models. However, learning such grammars is difficult. In this work, we propose to use information on protein contacts to facilitate the training of probabilistic context-free grammars representing families of protein sequences. We develop the theory behind the introduction of contact constraints in maximum-likelihood and contrastive estimation schemes and implement it in a machine learning framework for protein grammars. The proposed framework is tested on samples of protein motifs in comparison with learning without contact constraints. The evaluation shows high fidelity of grammatical descriptors to protein structures and improved precision in recognizing sequences. Finally, we present an example of using our method in a practical setting and demonstrate its potential beyond the current state of the art by creating a grammatical model of a meta-family of protein motifs.

We prove that every regular language is the image of a k-slt language on an alphabet of doubled size, where the width logarithmically depends on the automaton size, and we exhibit regular languages for which any smaller alphabetic ratio is insufficient. More generally, we express the trade-off between alphabetic ratio and width as a mathematical relation derived from a careful encoding of the states.

Given a sound negotiation, the summarization problem aims at computing an equivalent one-step negotiation with the same input/output behavior. The soundness and summarization problems can be solved by means of simple algorithms acting on the state space of the negotiation, which however face the well-known state explosion problem. We study alternative algorithms that avoid the construction of the state space. In particular, we define reduction rules that simplify a negotiation while preserving the sound/non-sound character of the negotiation and its summary. In a first result we show that our rules are complete for the class of weakly deterministic acyclic negotiations, meaning that they reduce all sound negotiations in this class, and only them, to equivalent one-step negotiations. This provides algorithms for both the soundness and the summarization problem that avoid the construction of the state space. We then study the class of deterministic negotiations.

It is the class of reversible transducers, for which the computation steps can be reversed determin-istically.

The proposed approach combines methods for uniform sampling of automata (for exploring qualitative shapes) with hit-and-run Monte Carlo sampling procedures (for exploring multi-dimensional parameter spaces defined by sets of possibly non-linear constraints).

The reachability problem asks for the existence of an assignment of the parameters to the non-negative integers such that reachability holds in the underlying timed automaton. The reachability problem for PTA is long known to be undecidable, already over three parametric clocks. \nA few years ago, Bundala and Ouaknine proved that for PTA over two parametric clocks and one parameter the reachability problem is decidable and also showed a lower bound for the complexity class PSPACE^NEXP. Our main result is that the reachability problem for two-parametric timed automata with one parameter is EXPSPACE-complete. Our contribution is two-fold. \nFor the EXPSPACE lower bound we make use of deep results from complexity theory, namely a serializability characterization of EXPSPACE (based on Barrington's Theorem) and a logspace translation of numbers in chinese remainder representation to binary representation. \nFor the EXPSPACE upper bound, we give a careful exponential time reduction from PTA over two parametric clocks and one parameter to a slight subclass of parametric one-counter automata (POCA) over one parameter based on a minor adjustment of a construction due to Bundala and Ouaknine. We provide a series of techniques to partition a fictitious run of a POCA into several carefully chosen subruns that allow us to prove that it is sufficient to consider a parameter value of exponential magnitude only. This allows us to show a doubly-exponential upper bound on the value of the only parameter of a PTA over two parametric clocks and one parameter.

Examples of complex specifications include properties expressed as formulae in linear temporal logic (LTL) or as automata on infinite strings. A general methodology to synthesize controllers for such properties resorts to symbolic models of the given stochastic systems. Symbolic models are finite abstractions of the given concrete systems with the property that a controller designed on the abstraction can be refined (or implemented) into a controller on the original system. Although the recent development of techniques for the construction of symbolic models has been quite encouraging, the general goal of formal synthesis over stochastic control systems is by no means solved. A fundamental issue with the existing techniques is the known \u201ccurse of dimensionality,\u201d which is due to the need to discretize state and input sets. Such discretization generally results in an exponential complexity over the number of state and input variables in the concrete system. In this work we propose a novel abstraction technique for incrementally stable stochastic control systems, which does not require state-space discretization but only input set discretization, and that can be potentially more efficient (and thus scalable) than existing approaches. We elucidate the effectiveness of the proposed approach by synthesizing a schedule for the coordination of two traffic lights under some safety and fairness requirements for a road traffic model.

We generalize Medvedev's result in a new direction, studying the relationship between the width and the alphabetic ratio telling how much larger the local alphabet is. We prove that every regular language is the image of a k-slt language on an alphabet of doubled size, where the width logarithmically depends on the automaton size, and we exhibit regular languages for which any smaller alphabetic ratio is insufficient.

Well structured transition systems (WSTS) were introduced in [2] and surveys can be found in [4, 1]. WSTS are ordered transition systems (S,\u2192,\u2264) enjoying two properties: (1) the ordering \u2264 is well on S and (2) \u2192 is monotone with respect to \u2264. Many classical properties are decidable for WSTS as termination, control-state reachability, coverability, boundedness,...etc. Given a program P and a safety property \u03c6 , let\u2019s describe two steps for verifying that P satisfies \u03c6 by using WSTS: 1. The first step is to build a transition system (S,\u2192) associated with (P,\u03c6) and in general it is an abstraction of the real program P because we may (and must) forget some useless parts of the program that have no effect on property \u03c6 . We have also to translate the property \u03c6 into a stateproperty in (S,\u2192) that is decidable for WSTS. 2. The second step is to look for a decidable ordering having these two desired properties. If we find such ordering, we just verify whether (S,\u2192) satisfies the state-property \u03c6 . Let us consider the case in which we found a well ordering \u2264 but (S,\u2192,\u2264) is unfortunately not monotone. One may look for a computable abstraction (S\u2032,\u2192\u2032,\u2264\u2032) of (S,\u2192,\u2264) where (S\u2032,\u2264\u2032) is an abstraction of (S,\u2264) such that the new transition relation\u2192\u2032 (between abstract states in S\u2032) is monotone with respect to \u2264\u2032 which is still well and then A\u2032 is a WSTS. Let us give two examples following this strategy that allows to analyse programs that are not directly translatable into WSTS. 1. Recall that the usual ordering on positive integers is well (Dickson Lemma) but it is not monotone on (general) counters machines because the zero-test guards are typically not monotone: but if we replace each zero test by a reset operation, the resulting machine is a WSTS (for the usual ordering extended on vectors) that over-approximates the original counter machine. 2. The subword ordering on finite words is well (Higman\u2019s Theorem) but it is not monotone on fifo machines ; however, it is monotone on fifo machines with the lossy semantics, hence lossy fifo machines are WSTS for the subword ordering. Lossy fifo machines over-approximates original fifo machines. Both reset counter machines and lossy fifo machines can serve as WSTS abstractions of programs and these WSTS abstractions allow to study safety properties in original programs.", "venue": "VPT/HCVS@ETAPS", "authors": ["Alain  Finkel"], "year": 2020, "n_citations": 1}

This is an important case of the general problem of extracting a PN from a TS. The decomposition is based on the theory of regions, and it is shown that a property of regions called excitation-closure is a sufficient condition to guarantee the equivalence between the original TS and a decomposition into SMs.An efficient algorithm is provided which solves the problem by reducing its critical steps to the maximal independent set problem (to compute a minimal set of irredundant SMs) or to satisfiability (to merge the SMs).

Given that the numerical method is consistent (i.e., the discretization error tends to zero as the discretization step tends to zero), and the method is stable (i.e., the error is uniformly bounded), we formally prove that the approximate solution converges to the true solution. We then demonstrate convergence of the difference scheme on an example problem by proving both its consistency and stability, and then applying the Lax equivalence theorem.

In our definition, we permit general classes of risk measures such as, but not limited to, the conditional value-at-risk.

Numerous generalisations of this result exist in the literature. Lifting this result to a weighted setting has been widely studied. Moreover, different monoids can be considered: for instance, two-way automata, and even tree-walking automata, can be described by expressions using the free inverse monoid. In the present work, we aim at combining both research directions and consider weighted extensions of automata and expressions over a class of monoids that we call pre-rational, generalising both the free inverse monoid and graded monoids. The presence of idempotent elements in these pre-rational monoids leads in the weighted setting to consider infinite sums. To handle such sums, we will have to restrict ourselves to rationally additive semirings. Our main result is thus a generalisation of the Kleene theorem for pre-rational monoids and rationally additive semirings.

This approach models the causes of subsystem failures in a highly-critical system and their potential consequences using Fault Tree (FT) and Event Tree (ET) methods, which are well-known dependability modeling techniques. Paper-and-pencil-based approaches and simulation tools, such as the Monte-Carlo approach, are commonly used to carry out CCD analysis, but lack the ability to rigorously verify essential system reliability properties. In this work, we propose to use formal techniques based on theorem proving for the formal modeling and step-analysis of CCDs to overcome the inaccuracies of the simulation-based analysis and the error-proneness of informal reasoning by mathematical proofs. In particular, we use the HOL4 theorem prover, which is a computer-based mathematical reasoning tool. To this end, we developed a formalization of CCDs in Higher-Order Logic (HOL), based on the algebraic approach, using HOL4. We demonstrate the practical effectiveness of the proposed CCD formalization by performing the formal reliability analysis of the IEEE 39-bus electrical power network. Also, we formally determine the Forced Outage Rate (FOR) of the power generation units and the network reliability index, i.e., System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI).

However, due to the increasing system complexity and the fundamental hardness of designing a controller with formal guarantees, such an open-loop process of design-then-verify often results in many iterations and fails to provide the necessary guarantees. In this paper, we propose a correct-by-construction control learning framework that integrates the verification into the control design process in a closed-loop manner, i.e., design-while-verify. Specifically, we leverage the verification results (computed reachable set of the system state) to construct feedback metrics for control learning, which measure how likely the current design of control parameters can meet the required reach-avoid property for safety and goal-reaching. We formulate an optimization problem based on such metrics for tuning the controller parameters, and develop an approximated gradient descent algorithm with a difference method to solve the optimization problem and learn the controller. The learned controller is formally guaranteed to meet the required reach-avoid property. By treating verifiability as a first-class objective and effectively leveraging the verification results during the control learning process, our approach can significantly improve the chance of finding a control design with formal property guarantees.

We consider three types of these stack constraints: after reading w, the stack (1) is empty in each run, (2) contains the same sequence of stack symbols in each run, or (3) contains an arbitrary sequence which is independent of the other runs. We show that in contrast to general deterministic push-down automata, it is decidable for deterministic visibly push-down automata whether there exists a synchronizing word with each of these stack constraints, i.e., the problems are in EXPTIME. Under the constraint (1) the problem is even in P. For the sub-classes of deterministic very visibly push-down automata the problem is in P for all three types of constraints. We further study variants of the synchronization problem where the number of turns in the stack height behavior caused by a synchronizing word is restricted, as well as the problem of synchronizing a variant of a sequential transducer, which shows some visibly behavior, by a word that synchronizes the states and produces the same output on all runs.", "venue": "FSTTCS", "authors": ["Henning  Fernau", "Petra  Wolf"], "year": 2020, "n_citations": 2}

Integer data type occurs naturally in string-manipulating programs, and is frequently used to refer to lengths of, or positions in, strings. Analysis and testing of string-manipulating programs can be formulated as the path feasibility problem: given a symbolic execution path, does there exist an assignment to the inputs that yields a concrete execution that realizes this path? Such a problem can naturally be reformulated as a string constraint solving problem. Although state-of-the-art string constraint solvers usually provide support for both string and integer data types, they mainly resort to heuristics without completeness guarantees. In this paper, we propose a decision procedure for a class of string-manipulating programs which includes not only a wide range of string operations such as concatenation, replaceAll, reverse, and finite transducers, but also those involving the integer data-type such as length, indexof, and substring. To the best of our knowledge, this represents one of the most expressive string constraint languages that is currently known to be decidable. Our decision procedure is based on a variant of cost register automata. We implement the decision procedure, giving rise to a new solver OSTRICH+. We evaluate the performance of OSTRICH+ on a wide range of existing and new benchmarks.

Often, two transducers that model similar systems differ locally from one another, by behaving similarly, up to permutations of the input and output letters within \u201crounds\u201d. In this work, we introduce and study notions of simulation by rounds and equivalence by rounds of transducers. In our setting, words are partitioned to consecutive subwords of a fixed length k, called rounds. Then, a transducer T1 is k-round simulated by transducer T2 if, intuitively, for every input word x, we can permute the letters within each round in x, such that the output of T2 on the permuted word is itself a permutation of the output of T1 on x. Finally, two transducers are k-round equivalent if they simulate each other. We solve two main decision problems, namely whether T2 k-round simulates T1 (1) when k is given as input, and (2) for an existentially quantified k. We demonstrate the usefulness of the definitions by applying them to process symmetry: a setting in which a permutation in the identities of processes in a multi-process system naturally gives rise to two transducers, whose k-round equivalence corresponds to stability against such permutations. 2012 ACM Subject Classification Theory of computation \u2192 Verification by model checking; Theory of computation \u2192 Abstraction; Theory of computation \u2192 Concurrency", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Antonio Abu Nassar", "Shaull  Almagor"], "year": 2021, "n_citations": 0}

In this paper, we propose a formal approach based on runtime enforcement to ensure specification compliance in networks of controllers, possibly compromised by colluding malware that may tamper with actuator commands, sensor readings, and inter-controller communications. Our approach relies on an ad-hoc sub-class of Ligatti et al.\u2019s edit automata to enforce controllers represented in Hennessy and Regan\u2019s Timed Process Language. We define a synthesis algorithm that, given an alphabet P of observable actions and a timed correctness property e , returns a monitor that enforces the property e during the execution of any (potentially corrupted) controller with alphabet P, and complying with the property e . Our monitors correct and suppress incorrect actions coming from corrupted controllers and emit actions in full autonomy when the controller under scrutiny is not able to do so in a correct manner. Besides classical requirements, such as transparency and soundness, the proposed enforcement enjoys deadlockand diverge-freedom of monitored controllers, together with scalability when dealing with networks of controllers. Finally, we test the proposed enforcement mechanism on a non-trivial case study, taken from the context of industrial water treatment systems, in which the controllers are injected with different malware with different malicious goals.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Ruggero  Lanotte", "Massimo  Merro", "Andrei  Munteanu"], "year": 2021, "n_citations": 0}

In a multi-outcome setting, the notion of winning strategy is irrelevant yet usually replaced faithfully with the notion of (pure) Nash equilibrium. This article shows that every determinacy result over an arbitrary game structure, e.g. a tree, is transferable into existence of multi-outcome (pure) Nash equilibrium over the same game structure.

But words can be ordered and among the many possible orders a very natural one is the co-lexicographic one. Such naturalness stems from the fact that it suggests a transfer of the order from words to the automaton\u2019s states. This suggestion is, in fact, concrete and in a number of papers automata admitting a total ordering of states coherent with the ordering of the set of words reaching them have been proposed, studied, and implemented. Such class of ordered automata\u2014the Wheeler automata\u2014turned out to be efficiently stored/searched using an index and the set of words reaching each of their states have been proved to be intervals of the co-lexicographic ordered Pref(L(A)). Unfortunately not all automata can be totally ordered as previously outlined. That is, in general not all sets of prefixes of L(A) reaching a given state form an interval in Pref(L(A)). However, automata can always be partially ordered and an intrinsic measure of their complexity can be defined and effectively determined, as the minimum width of one of their admissible partial orders. As shown in previous works, this new concept of width of an automaton has useful consequences in the fields of graph compression, indexing data structures, and automata theory. In this paper we prove that a canonical, minimum-width, partially-ordered, automaton accepting a language L\u2014dubbed the Hasse automaton H of L\u2014can be exhibited. H provides, in a precise sense, the best possible way to (partially) order the states of any automaton accepting L, as long as we want to maintain an operational link with the (co-lexicographic) order of Pref(L(A)). The difficulty in defining the Hasse automaton is a consequence of the existence of (co-lex) monotone sequences of words reaching infinitely many times more than one state of any deterministic automaton accepting L. Properly constructing the Hasse\u2019s automaton requires a distribution of these monotone sequences upon H\u2019s states on different linear components of the underlying partial order. The number of such linear components (i.e. the width of the underlying partial order) intrinsically constrains the index-ability and, hence, the complexity of L. We prove that such a complexity, that is, the width of the language, can be effectively computed from the minimum automaton recognizing the language.

For this reason the problem of identifying and reacting to faults has received a large attention in the control and computer science communities. In this paper we study the fault diagnosis problem for hybrid systems from a game-theoretical point of view. A hybrid system is a system mixing continuous and discrete behaviours that cannot be faithfully modeled neither by using a formalism with continuous dynamics only nor by a formalism including only discrete dynamics. We use the well known framework of hybrid automata for modeling hybrid systems, and we define a Fault Diagnosis Game on them, using two players: the environment and the diagnoser. The environment controls the evolution of the system and chooses whether and when a fault occurs. The diagnoser observes the external behaviour of the system and announces whether a fault has occurred or not. Existence of a winning strategy for the diagnoser implies that faults can be detected correctly, while computing such a winning strategy corresponds to implement a diagnoser for the system. We will show how to determine the existence of a winning strategy, and how to compute it, for some decidable classes of hybrid automata like o-minimal hybrid automata.", "venue": "GandALF", "authors": ["Davide  Bresolin", "Marta  Capiluppi"], "year": 2011, "n_citations": 3}

With an appropriate label splitting, we can always obtain a solution for the synthesis or embedding problem. Using the label splitting, we can construct a labelled Petri net with the intended bahaviour (e.g. embedding the given LTS in its reachability graph).

In MapReduce, the reducer produces an output from a list of inputs. Due to the scheduling policy of the platform, the inputs may arrive at the reducers in different order. The commutativity problem of reducers asks if the output of a reducer is independent of the order of its inputs. Although the problem is undecidable in general, the MapReduce programs in practice are usually used for data analytics and thus require very simple control flow. By exploiting the simplicity, we propose a programming language for reducers where the commutativity problem is decidable. The main idea of the reducer language is to separate the control and data flow of programs and disallow arithmetic operations in the control flow. The decision procedure for the commutativity problem is obtained through a reduction to the equivalence problem of streaming numerical transducers (SNTs), a novel automata model over infinite alphabets introduced in this paper. The design of SNTs is inspired by streaming transducers (Alur and Cerny, POPL 2011). Nevertheless, the two models are intrinsically different since the outputs of SNTs are integers while those of streaming transducers are data words. The decidability of the equivalence of SNTs is achieved with an involved combinatorial analysis of the evolvement of the values of the integer variables during the runs of SNTs.", "venue": "CAV", "authors": ["Yu-Fang  Chen", "Lei  Song", "Zhilin  Wu"], "year": 2016, "n_citations": 9}

In this paper, we solve the problem of expressions capturing first order definable functions, thereby generalizing the seminal SF=AP (star-free expressions = aperiodic languages) result of Sch\u00fctzenberger. Our result also generalizes a lesser known characterization by Schutzenberger of aperiodic languages by SD-regular expressions (SD=AP). We show that every first order definable function over finite words captured by an aperiodic deterministic two-way transducer can be described with an SD-regular transducer expression (SDRTE). An SDRTE is a regular expression where Kleene stars are used in a restricted way: they can appear only on aperiodic languages which are prefix codes of bounded synchronization delay. SDRTEs are constructed from simple functions using the combinators unambiguous sum (deterministic choice), Hadamard product, and unambiguous versions of the Cauchy product and the fc-chained Kleene-star, where the star is restricted as mentioned. In order to construct an SDRTE associated with an aperiodic deterministic two-way transducer, (i) we concretize Schutzenberger\u2019s SD=AP result, by proving that aperiodic languages are captured by SD-regular expressions which are unambiguous and stabilising; (ii) by structural induction on the unambiguous, stabilising SD-regular expressions describing the domain of the transducer, we construct SDRTEs.

It asks whether the current and subsequent states of a system can be determined based on observations. Since, in some applications, to exactly determine the current and subsequent states may be too strict, a relaxed notion of D-detectability has been introduced, distinguishing only certain pairs of states rather than all states. Four variants of D-detectability have been defined: strong (periodic) D-detectability and weak (periodic) D-detectability. Deciding weak (periodic) D-detectability is PSpace-complete, while deciding strong (periodic) detectability or strong D-detectability is polynomial (and we show that it is actually NL-complete). However, to the best of our knowledge, it is an open problem whether there exists a polynomial-time algorithm deciding strong periodic D-detectability. We solve this problem by showing that deciding strong periodic D-detectability is a PSpace-complete problem, and hence there is no polynomial-time algorithm unless PSpace = P.

We show the structures given by these models are partially ordered, and present a learning algorithm that exploits this ordering relation to effectively prune the hypothesis space. We prove this learning algorithm, which takes positive examples as input, finds the most general grammar which covers the data.", "venue": "Proceedings of the 16th Meeting on the Mathematics of Language", "authors": ["Jane  Chandlee", "Remi  Eyraud", "Jeffrey  Heinz", "Adam  Jardine", "Jonathan  Rawski"], "year": 2019, "n_citations": 2}

In particular, we study the problem of measuring the behavioral dissimilarity of two SMMs against linear real-time specifications expressed as Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formulas or Deterministic Timed-Automata (DTA). The most natural choice for such a distance is the one that measures the maximal difference that can be observed comparing two SMMs with respect to their probability of satisfying an arbitrary specification. We show that computing this metric is NP-hard. In addition, we show that any algorithm that approximates the distance within a certain absolute error, depending on the size of the SMMs, is NP-hard. Nevertheless, we introduce an alternative distance, based on the Kantorovich metric, that is an over-approximation of the former and we show that, under mild assumptions on the residence time distributions, it can be computed in polynomial time.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Giorgio  Bacci", "Giovanni  Bacci", "Kim G.

A function that generates pseudorandom strings from shorter but truly random seeds is known as a pseudorandom generator. Our generators are designed to fool languages (or equivalently, Boolean-valued functions). In particular, our generator fools advised context-free languages, namely, context-free languages assisted by external information known as advice, and moreover our generator is made almost one-to-one, stretching $n$-bit seeds to $n+1$ bits. We explicitly construct such a pseudorandom generator, which is computed by a deterministic Turing machine using logarithmic space and also belongs to CFLMV(2)/n---a functional extension of the 2-conjunctive closure of CFL with the help of appropriate deterministic advice. In contrast, we show that there is no almost one-to-one pseudorandom generator against context-free languages if we demand that it should be computed by a nondeterministic pushdown automaton equipped with a write-only output tape. Our generator naturally extends known pseudorandom generators against advised regular languages. Our proof of the CFL/n-pseudorandomness of the generator is quite elementary, and in particular, one part of the proof utilizes a special feature of the behaviors of nondeterministic pushdown automata, called a swapping property, which is interesting in its own right, generalizing the swapping lemma for context-free languages.", "venue": "Theor.

The notionof time takes center stage for this kind of systems: abstracting from the time we may loose thecore properties of a system we represent, e.g. in many cases the causality property can be loosed.In particular, the timed domain is the most important one for representation of distributed systemswith real-time requirements.On the other hand, in many cases arguing about time makes the speci\ufb01cation more readablefor an average engineer: speci\ufb01cation of a real-time system in an untimed frame may be in somecases shorter or more elegant from mathematical point of view, but to understand such speci\ufb01ca-tions and to argue about their properties is in many cases much more dif\ufb01cult in comparison tothe corresponding speci\ufb01cations in a timed frame, where some properties like causality could berepresented explicitly. Moreover, abstraction from timing aspects can easily lead to speci\ufb01cationmistakes because of dif\ufb01culties to \ufb01nd a correct abstraction.One of the most well-established models for the speci\ufb01cation and veri\ufb01cation of real-timesystem design is representation of a system using timed automata, introduced by Alur andDill [AD94] \u2013 them extend the classical \ufb01nite automata by a \ufb01nite set of real valued clocksused to measure the time elapsed between events to constrain the runs of the automation. Themodel from Alur and Dill is well-developed, however, some its assumptions on the system couldbe too idealistic: timed automata assumes perfect continuity of clocks and, what could be evenmore critical if we deal with embedded systems, instantaneous reaction times. Another problemof this model is that it does not prevent Zeno runs [GB07]. To solve this, the idea of robust modelchecking was introduced by Puri [Pur00] and also revised in other approaches.We suggest another solution: to argue not about a single action or messages but about timeintervals containing a \ufb01nite number of actions, i.e. to argue not about single messages in aninput stream, but about a sequence of messages that are present in this stream at some timeinterval. This sequence can be in general either empty or contain a single message or a numberof messages. In this approach a discrete model of time is used, because (i) this simpli\ufb01es thespeci\ufb01cation and, even more, the veri\ufb01cation of system properties, and (ii) any timed transitionsystem can be discretized without loss of generality. Thus, an input for our timed automata or,more generally, a timed component, is an in\ufb01nite sequence of \ufb01nite time intervals.However a discrete model of time is used here, ones can choose any time granularity de\ufb01ningthe concrete meaning of a time interval according to the system requirements, and, moreover,it is possible to switch from one time granularity to another: the operator s \u2019", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Maria  Spichkova"], "year": 2014, "n_citations": 6}

We prove that there exists no compositional and interaction sensitive encoding of a not strongly replacement free calculus into any strongly replacement free one.

This definition is motivated by the question which \u03c9-words admit infinite orbits: for such a word, every prefix is expandable. In this paper, we show that, given a word u, an automaton T and a number k as input, it is decidable to check whether u is k-expandable with respect to the action of T . In fact, this can be done in exponential nondeterministic space. From this nondeterministic algorithm, we obtain a bound on the length of a potential orbit-increasing suffix x. Moreover, we investigate the situation if the automaton is invertible and generates a group. In this case, we give an algebraic characterization for the expandability of a word based on its shifted stabilizer. We also give a more efficient algorithm to decide the expandability of a word in the case of automaton groups, which allows us to improve the upper bound on the maximal orbit-increasing suffix length. Then, we investigate the situation for reversible (and complete) automata and obtain that every word is expandable with respect to such automata.

Specification-driven trace-checking tools for CPS usually provide users with a specification language to express the requirements of interest, and an automatic procedure to check whether these requirements hold on the execution traces of a CPS. Although there exist several specification languages for CPS, they are often not sufficiently expressive to allow the specification of complex CPS properties related to the software and the physical components and their interactions. In this paper, we propose (i) the Hybrid Logic of Signals (HLS), a logic-based language that allows the specification of complex CPS requirements, and (ii) ThEodorE, an efficient SMT-based trace-checking procedure. This procedure reduces the problem of checking a CPS requirement over an execution trace, to checking the satisfiability of an SMT formula. We evaluated our contributions by using a representative industrial case study in the satellite domain. We assessed the expressiveness of HLS by considering 212 requirements of our case study. HLS could express all the 212 requirements. We also assessed the applicability of ThEodorE by running the trace-checking procedure for 747 trace-requirement combinations. ThEodorE was able to produce a verdict in 74.5% of the cases. Finally, we compared HLS and ThEodorE with other specification languages and trace-checking tools from the literature.

The translation is enabled by using MONA, a powerful tool for symbolic, BDD-based, DFA construction from logic specifications. Recent works used a first-order encoding of LTLf formulas to translate LTLf to First Order Logic (FOL), which is then fed to MONA to get the symbolic DFA. This encoding was shown to perform well, but other encodings have not been studied. Specifically, the natural question of whether second-order encoding, which has significantly simpler quantificational structure, can outperform first-order encoding remained open. \nIn this paper we address this challenge and study second-order encodings for LTLf formulas. We first introduce a specific MSO encoding that captures the semantics of LTLf in a natural way and prove its correctness. We then explore is a Compact MSO encoding, which benefits from automata-theoretic minimization, thus suggesting a possible practical advantage. To that end, we propose a formalization of symbolic DFA in second-order logic, thus developing a novel connection between BDDs and MSO. We then show by empirical evaluations that the first-order encoding does perform better than both second-order encodings. The conclusion is that first-order encoding is a better choice than second-order encoding in LTLf-to-Automata translation.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Shufang  Zhu", "Geguang  Pu", "Moshe Y.

The lack of proper error recovery makes PEG parsers unsuitable for using with Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), which need to build syntactic trees even for incomplete, syntactically invalid programs. We propose a conservative extension, based on PEGs with labeled failures, that adds a syntax error recovery mechanism for PEGs. This extension associates recovery expressions to labels, where a label now not only reports a syntax error but also uses this recovery expression to reach a synchronization point in the input and resume parsing. We give an operational semantics of PEGs with this recovery mechanism, and use an implementation based on such semantics to build a robust parser for the Lua language.

While there is no reason to doubt the veracity of the results known so far, it is difficult to accept such results as scientifically proven without being able to inspect the appropriate evidence. In addition, a list of machines and their classifications can be used for other results, such as variations on the busy beaver problem and related problems such as the placid platypus problem.

The model of Streaming String Transducers (SSTs) is the fragment of SDSTs where the infinite data domain is dropped and only finite alphabets are considered. SSTs have been much studied from a language theoretical point of view. We introduce data back into SSTs, just like data was introduced to finite state automata to get register automata.

The resulting algorithm not only achieves decentralized control of the swarm but also significantly improves scalability over state-of-the-art existing algorithms. Specifically, we study a setting in which the agents move along the nodes of a graph, and the high-level task specifications for the swarm are expressed in a recently-proposed language called graph temporal logic (GTL). By constraining the distribution of the swarm over the nodes of the graph, GTL can specify a wide range of properties, including safety, progress, and response. GTLProCo, agnostic to the number of agents comprising the swarm, controls the density distribution of the swarm in a decentralized and probabilistic manner. To this end, it synthesizes a time-varying Markov chain modeling the time evolution of the density distribution under the GTL constraints. We first identify a subset of GTL, namely reach-avoid specifications, for which we can reduce the synthesis of such a Markov chain to either linear or semi-definite programs. Then, in the general case, we formulate the synthesis of the Markov chain as a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP). We exploit the structure of the problem to provide an efficient sequential mixed-integer linear programming scheme with trust regions to solve the MINLP.

Recent in-memory automata accelerators leveraging SRAMs and DRAMs have shown exciting improvements over conventional digital designs. However, the bit-vector representation of state transitions used by all state-of-the-art (SOTA) designs is only optimal in processing worst-case completely random patterns, while a significant amount of memory and energy is wasted in running most real-world benchmarks. We present CAMA, a Content-Addressable Memory (CAM) enabled Automata accelerator for processing homogeneous nondeterministic finite automata (NFA). A radically different state representation scheme, along with co-designed novel circuits and data encoding schemes, greatly reduces energy, memory, and chip area for most realistic NFAs. CAMA is holistically optimized with the following major contributions: (1) a 16\u00d7256 8-transistor (8T) CAM array for state matching, replacing the 256\u00d7256 6T SRAM array or two 16\u00d7256 6T SRAM banks in state-of-theart (SOTA) designs; (2) a novel encoding scheme that enables content searching within 8T SRAMs and adapts to different applications; (3) a reconfigurable and scalable architecture that improves efficiency on all tested benchmarks, without losing support for any NFA that\u2019s compatible with SOTA designs; (4) an optimization framework that automates the choice of encoding schemes and maps a given NFA to the proposed hardware. Two versions of CAMA, one optimized for energy (CAMA-E) and the other for throughput (CAMA-T), are comprehensively evaluated in a 28nm CMOS process, and across 21 real-world and synthetic benchmarks. CAMA-E achieves 2.1\u00d7, 2.8\u00d7, and 2.04\u00d7 lower energy than CA, 2-stride Impala, and eAP.

An approach would be to train a recurrent neural network (RNN) to classify the sample data and attempt to extract these PDA rules. But neural networks are not a priori aware of the structure of a PDA and would likely require many samples to infer this structure. Furthermore, extracting the PDA rules from the RNN is nontrivial. We build a RNN specifically structured like a PDA, where weights correspond directly to the PDA rules. This requires a stack architecture that is somehow differentiable (to enable gradient-based learning) and stable (an unstable stack will show deteriorating performance with longer strings). We propose a stack architecture that is differentiable and that provably exhibits orbital stability.

To complement these results we show that imposing the same restrictions on BD-LTL yields two 2ExpSpace-complete fragments while satisfiability for the full logic is known to be as hard as reachability in Petri nets.", "venue": "CONCUR", "authors": ["Normann  Decker", "Peter  Habermehl", "Martin  Leucker", "Daniel  Thoma"], "year": 2014, "n_citations": 25}

We provide an algorithm for the approximate minimization of black boxes trained for language modelling of sequential data over a one-letter alphabet. By reformulating the problem in terms of Hankel matrices, we leverage classical results on the approximation of Hankel operators, namely the celebrated Adamyan-ArovKrein (AAK) theory. This allows us to use the spectral norm to measure the distance between the black box and the WFA. We provide theoretical guarantees to study the potentially infinite-rank Hankel matrix of the black box, without accessing the training data, and we prove that our method returns an asymptotically-optimal approximation.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Clara  Lacroce", "Prakash  Panangaden", "Guillaume  Rabusseau"], "year": 2021, "n_citations": 0}

Unfortunately, these mitigations intertwine model checking with heuristics of the underlying SMT-solver, negatively affecting stability of model checking. In this paper, we propose to tackle the limitations of locality in a systematic manner. We introduce explicit global guidance into the local reasoning performed by IC3-style algorithms.

This paper is a continuation of the abelian networks series of Bond and Levine (2016), for which we extend the theory of abelian networks that halt on all inputs to networks that can run forever. A nonhalting abelian network can be realized as a discrete dynamical system in many different ways, depending on the update order. We show that certain features of the dynamics, such as minimal period length, have intrinsic definitions that do not require specifying an update order. \nWe give an intrinsic definition of the \\emph{torsion group} of a finite irreducible (halting or nonhalting) abelian network, and show that it coincides with the critical group of Bond and Levine (2016) if the network is halting. We show that the torsion group acts freely on the set of invertible recurrent components of the trajectory digraph, and identify when this action is transitive. \nThis perspective leads to new results even in the classical case of sinkless rotor networks (deterministic analogues of random walks). In Holroyd et. al (2008) it was shown that the recurrent configurations of a sinkless rotor network with just one chip are precisely the unicycles (spanning subgraphs with a unique oriented cycle, with the chip on the cycle). We generalize this result to abelian mobile agent networks with any number of chips.

Formal synthesis methods derived from symbolic systems have great potential for reasoning about high-level locomotion decisions and achieving complex maneuvering behaviors with correctness guarantees. This study takes a first step toward formally devising an architecture composed of task planning and control of whole-body dynamic locomotion behaviors in constrained and dynamically changing environments. At the high level, we formulate a two-player temporal logic game between the multi-limb locomotion planner and its dynamic environment to synthesize a winning strategy that delivers symbolic locomotion actions. These locomotion actions satisfy the desired high-level task specifications expressed in a fragment of temporal logic. Those actions are sent to a robust finite transition system that synthesizes a locomotion controller that fulfills state reachability constraints. This controller is further executed via a low-level motion planner that generates feasible locomotion trajectories. We construct a set of dynamic locomotion models for legged robots to serve as a template library for handling diverse environmental events. We devise a replanning strategy that takes into consideration sudden environmental changes or large state disturbances to increase the robustness of the resulting locomotion behaviors. We formally prove the correctness of the layered locomotion framework guaranteeing a robust implementation by the motion planning layer.

With no endmarkers, by contrast, a machine must constantly stay in either accepting or rejecting states at any moment since it never notices the end of the input instance. This situation, however, helps us analyze the behavior of the machine whose tape head makes the consecutive moves on all prefixes of a given extremely long input word. Since those two machine formulations have their own advantages, it is natural to ask whether the endmarkers are truly necessary to correctly recognize languages. In the deterministic and nondeterministic models, it is well-known that the endmarkers are removable without changing the acceptance criteria of each input instance. This paper proves that, for a more general model of one-way probabilistic pushdown automata, the endmarkers are also removable.

In (Bourreau et al., 2012), the operation of IO-ubstitution was created so as to exhibit mildly context-sensitive classes of languages which are not semilinear, although they verify the constant-growth property. In the present article, we extend the notion of semilinearity, and characterise the Parikh image of the IO-MCFLs (i.e. languages which belong to the closure of MCFLs under IO-subsitution) as universally-linear. Based on this result and on the work of Fischer on macro-grammars, we then show IO-MCFLs are not closed under inverse homomorphism, which proves that the family of IO-MCFLs is not an abstract family of languages.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Pierre  Bourreau"], "year": 2013, "n_citations": 0}

In this paper, it is shown that all free-choice nets having a home cluster are lucent. These nets have a so-called home marking such that it is always possible to reach this marking again. Such a home marking can serve as a regeneration point or as an end-point.

Their stack can be used to model the call stack of a first-order recursive program, with the control state holding valuations of the program\u2019s global variables, and stack characters encoding the local variable valuations. As such the control flow of first-order recursive programs (such as C and Java programs) can be accurately modelled [29]. Pushdown systems have played a key role in the automata-theoretic approach to software model checking and considerable progress has been made in the implementation of scalable model checkers of pushdown systems. These tools (e.g. Bebop [3] and Moped [21, 39, 52, 50]) are an essential back-end components of high-profile model checkers such as SLAM [2]. A fundamental result for the model-checking of pushdown systems was established by Buchi in [12]. He showed that the set of stack contents reachable from the initial configuration of a pushdown system form a regular language and hence can be represented by a finite state automaton. The procedure provided by Buchi to compute this automaton from the pushdown system is exponential. In [15], Caucal gave the first polynomial time algorithm to solve this problem. This efficient computation is obtained by a saturation process where transitions are incrementally added to the finite automaton. This technique, which is the topic of this survey, was simplified and adapted to the model-checking setting by Bouajjani et al. in [7] and independently by Finkel et al. in [22]. The saturation technique allows global model checking of pushdown systems. For example, one may construct a regular representation of all configurations reachable from a given set of initial configurations, or, dually, the set of all configurations that may reach a given set of target configurations. As well as providing direct solutions to simple reachability properties (e.g. can an error state be reached from a designated initial configuration), the representations constructed by global analyses may be reused in a variety of settings. For example, once may perform multiple (and dynamic) queries on the set of reachable states without having to re-run the model checking routine. Additionally, these representations may be combined as part of a larger algorithm or proof. For example, Bouajjani et al. provided solutions to the model checking problem for the alternation free \u03bc-calculus by combining the results obtained through multiple global reachability analyses [7]. In this survey, we present the saturation method under its different forms for reachability problems in Section 3. The saturation technique also generalises to the analysis of two-players games played over the configuration graph of a pushdown systems.

The statically determined memory bound allows for a compilation to an FPGA with a fixed size. An advantage of FPGAs is a simple integration process in existing systems and superb executing time.

A parameterized family defines an infinite-state system: for each number n, the family consists of an instance with n finite-state processes. In contrast to safety, the parameterized verification of liveness is currently still considered extremely challenging especially in the presence of probabilities in the model. One major challenge is to provide a sufficiently powerful symbolic framework. One well-known symbolic framework for the parameterized verification of non-probabilistic concurrent systems is regular model checking. Although the framework was recently extended to probabilistic systems, incorporating fairness in the framework - often crucial for verifying termination - has been especially difficult due to the presence of an infinite number of fairness constraints (one for each process). Our main contribution is a systematic, regularity-preserving, encoding of finitary fairness (a realistic notion of fairness proposed by Alur & Henzinger) in the framework of regular model checking for probabilistic parameterized systems. Our encoding reduces termination with finitary fairness to verifying parameterized termination without fairness over probabilistic systems in regular model checking (for which a verification framework already exists). We show that our algorithm could verify termination for many interesting examples from distributed algorithms (Herman's protocol) and evolutionary biology (Moran process, cell cycle switch), which do not hold under the standard notion of fairness.

Such techniques incorporate additional locking circuitry within an integrated circuit (IC) that induces incorrect digital functionality when an incorrect verification key is provided by a user. The amount of error induced by an incorrect key is known as the\n effectiveness\n of the locking technique. A family of attacks known as \u201cSAT attacks\u201d provide a strong mathematical formulation to find the correct key of locked circuits. To achieve high\n SAT resilience\n (i.e., complexity of SAT attacks), many conventional logic locking schemes fail to inject sufficient error into the circuit when the key is incorrect. For example, in the case of SARLock and Anti-SAT, there are usually very few (or only one) input minterms that cause any error at the circuit output. The state-of-the-art\n s\n tripped functionality logic locking (SFLL) technique provides a wide spectrum of configurations that introduced a tradeoff between SAT resilience and effectiveness. In this work, we prove that such a tradeoff is universal among all logic locking techniques. To attain high effectiveness of locking without compromising SAT resilience, we propose a novel logic locking scheme, called Strong Anti-SAT (SAS). In addition to SAT attacks, removal-based attacks are another popular kind of attack formulation against logic locking where the attacker tries to identify and remove the locking structure. Based on SAS, we also propose Robust SAS (RSAS) that is resilient to removal attacks and maintains the same\n SAT resilience\n and\n effectiveness\n as SAS. SAS and RSAS have the following significant improvements over existing techniques. (1) We prove that the\n SAT resilience\n of SAS and RSAS against SAT attack is not compromised by increase in\n effectiveness\n . (2) In contrast to prior work that focused solely on the circuit-level locking impact, we integrate SAS-locked modules into an 80386 processor and show that SAS has a high application-level impact.

The agent intentionally introduces asymmetric information to create payoff misperception, which manifests as the misperception of the labeling function in the game model. Thus, the adversary is unable to accurately determine which logical formula is satisfied by a given outcome of the game. We introduce a model called hypergame on graph to capture the asymmetrical information with one-sided payoff misperception. Based on this model, we present the solution of such a hypergame and use the solution to synthesize stealthy deceptive strategies. Specifically, deceptive sure winning and deceptive almost-sure winning strategies are developed by reducing the hypergame to a two-player game and one-player stochastic game with reachability objectives. A running example is introduced to demonstrate the game model and the solution concept used for strategy synthesis.", "venue": "IEEE Control Systems Letters", "authors": ["Abhishek N.

A union-free language is deterministic if it can be accepted by a deterministic one-cycle-free-path finite automaton; this is an automaton which has one final state and exactly one cycle-free path from any state to the final state. Jir\\'askov\\'a and Masopust proved that the state complexities of the basic operations reversal, star, product, and boolean operations in deterministic union-free languages are exactly the same as those in the class of all regular languages. To prove that the bounds are met they used five types of automata, involving eight types of transformations of the set of states of the automata. We show that for each $n\\ge 3$ there exists one ternary witness of state complexity $n$ that meets the bound for reversal and product. Moreover, the restrictions of this witness to binary alphabets meet the bounds for star and boolean operations. We also show that the tight upper bounds on the state complexity of binary operations that take arguments over different alphabets are the same as those for arbitrary regular languages. Furthermore, we prove that the maximal syntactic semigroup of a union-free language has $n^n$ elements, as in the case of regular languages, and that the maximal state complexities of atoms of union-free languages are the same as those for regular languages. Finally, we prove that there exists a most complex union-free language that meets the bounds for all these complexity measures.

For this family, we show that even two-way nondeterminism does not help to save a single state.

Until now a full analysis of all DFAs reaching this bound was only given for [Formula: see text], and with bounds on the number of symbols for [Formula: see text]. Here we give the full analysis for [Formula: see text], without bounds on the number of symbols. For PFAs (partial automata) on [Formula: see text] states we do a similar analysis as for DFAs and find the maximal shortest synchronizing word lengths, exceeding [Formula: see text] for [Formula: see text]. Where DFAs with long synchronization typically have very few symbols, for PFAs we observe that more symbols may increase the synchronizing word length. For PFAs on [Formula: see text] states and two symbols we investigate all occurring synchronizing word lengths. We give series of PFAs on two and three symbols, reaching the maximal possible length for some small values of [Formula: see text]. For [Formula: see text], the construction on two symbols is the unique one reaching the maximal length. For both series the growth is faster than [Formula: see text], although still quadratic. Based on string rewriting, for arbitrary size we construct a PFA on three symbols with exponential shortest synchronizing word length, giving significantly better bounds than earlier exponential constructions. We give a transformation of this PFA to a PFA on two symbols keeping exponential shortest synchronizing word length, yielding a better bound than applying a similar known transformation.

Inspired by the view of the simulation hypothesis (but independent of this hypothesis), we propose a new method of logical reasoning named \"Computer-Simulation Model Theory\", CSMT. Computer-Simulation Model Theory is an extension of Mathematical Model Theory where instead of mathematical-structures, computer-simulations are replaced, and the activity of reasoning and computing of the reasoner is also simulated in the model.

The major difficulty of this framework is the inference of clock resets, central to the dynamics of timed automata, but not directly observable. Interesting first steps have already been made by restricting to the subclass of event-recording automata, where clock resets are tied to observations. In order to advance towards learning of general timed automata, we generalize this method to a new class, called reset-free event-recording automata, where some transitions may reset no clocks. This offers the same challenges as generic timed automata while keeping the simpler framework of event-recording automata for the sake of readability.

Our definition of pPDA allows both probabilistic and non-deterministic branching, generalising the classical notion of pushdown automata (without epsilon-transitions). We first show a general characterization of probabilistic bisimilarity in terms of two-player games, which naturally reduces checking bisimilarity of probabilistic labelled transition systems to checking bisimilarity of standard (non-deterministic) labelled transition systems. This reduction can be easily implemented in the framework of pPDA, allowing to use known results for standard (non-probabilistic) PDA and their subclasses. A direct use of the reduction incurs an exponential increase of complexity, which does not matter in deriving decidability of bisimilarity for pPDA due to the non-elementary complexity of the problem. In the cases of probabilistic one-counter automata (pOCA), of probabilistic visibly pushdown automata (pvPDA), and of probabilistic basic process algebras (i.e., single-state pPDA) we show that an implicit use of the reduction can avoid the complexity increase; we thus get PSPACE, EXPTIME, and 2-EXPTIME upper bounds, respectively, like for the respective non-probabilistic versions.

Our result follows our previous circuit-based enumeration algorithms based on deterministic tree automata, and is also inspired by our earlier result on words and nondeterministic sequential extended variable-set automata in the context of document spanners.

Our result implies that, for MSO queries with free first-order variables, we can enumerate the results with linear preprocessing and constant-delay and update the underlying tree in logarithmic time, which improves on several known results for words and trees.

However, its comprehensiveness makes the planning and control in POMDP difficult. Traditional POMDP planning problems target to find the optimal policy to maximize the expectation of accumulated rewards. But for safety critical applications, guarantees of system performance described by formal specifications are desired, which motivates us to consider formal methods to synthesize supervisor for POMDP. With system specifications given by Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic (PCTL), we propose a supervisory control framework with a type of deterministic finite automata (DFA), za-DFA, as the controller form. While the existing work mainly relies on optimization techniques to learn fixed-size finite state controllers (FSCs), we develop an $L^*$ learning based algorithm to determine both space and transitions of za-DFA.

Their conceptual extension is the non-deterministic finite automata which also have plenty of applications. In this article, we study these models through the lens of succinct data structures where our ultimate goal is to encode these mathematical objects using information-theoretically optimal number of bits along with supporting queries on them efficiently. Towards this goal, we first design a succinct data structure for representing any deterministic finite automaton $\\mathcal{D}$ having $n$ states over a $\\sigma$-letter alphabet $\\Sigma$ using $(\\sigma-1) n\\log n + O(n \\log \\sigma)$ bits of space, which can determine, given an input string $x$ over $\\Sigma$, whether $\\mathcal{D}$ accepts $x$ in $O(|x| \\log \\sigma)$ time, using constant words of working space.

Mathematically, they take the form of labelled cubical complexes. It is important to know, and challenging from a geometric/topological perspective, whether the space of directed paths (executions in the model) between two vertices (states) is connected; more generally, to estimate higher connectedness of these path spaces. This paper presents an approach for such an estimation for particularly simple HDA modelling the access of a number of processors to a number of resources with given limited capacity each. It defines a spare capacity for a concurrent program with prescribed periods of access of the processors to the resources. It shows that the connectedness of spaces of directed paths can be estimated (from above) by spare capacities. Moreover, spare capacities can also be used to detect deadlocks and critical states in such a HDA. The key theoretical ingredient is a transition from the calculation of local connectedness bounds (of the upper links of vertices of an HDA) to global ones by applying a version of the nerve lemma due to Anders Bj\u00f6rner. 1. PV programs and their geometric semantics 1.1. Euclidean cubical complexes and path spaces. In this paper, we consider an old and simple model for concurrent computation, the so-called PV models going back to Dijkstra [4]: In the simplest situation, consider n processors pj \u2208 P each executing a linear program. During execution, a processor may lock (Pr) and relinquish (V r) one or several resources r from a pool R of resources; possibly several times. Any resource r \u2208 R has capacity to serve up to \u03ba(r) \u2208 N processors at any given time. Every execution of a linear program for a given processor corresponds to a directed map pj : I = [0, 1] \u2192 Ij; here, Ij is a finite closed interval; and directed means continuous and (not necessarily strictly) increasing. Disregarding conflicting locks in the first place, any concurrent execution corresponds to a (componentwise) directed path p : I \u2192 \u220fn j=1 Ij \u2286 R . Capacity restrictions disallow these d-paths to enter a forbidden region F \u2282 Ij \u2286 R n (at least one of the resources locked by more processors than its capacity allows); the \u201callowed\u201d state space X \u2282 R for such a PV program is the complement of the forbidden region F within \u220fn j=1 Ij . For details cf Section 2.2 or the more comprehensive description in Fajstrup etal. [6, ch. 3]. This state space is a very particular simple case of a pre-cubical set or rather its geometric realization (cf [6, ch. 3.4], Ziemia\u0144ski [21, Sect. 1], [22, Sect. 2.4]) underlying general Higher Dimensional Automata introduced by Pratt [11] and analyzed by van Glabbeek, cf eg [18]).

Correctness is specified using safety and liveness requirements. Designing correct distributed protocols is a challenging task. Aimed at simplifying this task, we allow the designer to leave some of the guards and updates to state variables in the description of the protocol as unknown functions. The protocol completion problem then is to find interpretations for these unknown functions while guaranteeing correctness. In many distributed protocols, process behaviors are naturally symmetric, and thus, synthesized expressions are further required to obey symmetry constraints. Our counterexample-guided synthesis algorithm consists of repeatedly invoking two phases. In the first phase, candidates for unknown expressions are generated using the SMT solver Z3. This phase requires carefully orchestrating constraints to enforce the desired symmetry constraints. In the second phase, the resulting completed protocol is checked for correctness using a custom-built model checker that handles fairness assumptions, safety and liveness requirements, and exploits symmetry. When model checking fails, our tool examines a set of counterexamples to safety/liveness properties to generate constraints on unknown functions that must be satisfied by subsequent completions.

Such games are a commonly used model in many formal methods, as they make the interaction of a system with its environment explicit. Often, a winning strategy for one of the players is used as a certificate or as an artefact for further processing in the application. Small such certificates, i.e., strategies that can be written down very compactly, are typically preferred. For safety games, we only need to consider positional strategies. These map game positions of a player onto a move that is to be taken by the player whenever the play enters that position. For representing positional strategies compactly, a common goal is to minimize the number of positions for which a winning player's move needs to be defined such that the game is still won by the same player, without visiting a position with an undefined next move. We call winning strategies in which the next move is defined for few of the player's positions sparse. \nUnfortunately, even roughly approximating the density of the sparsest strategy for a safety game has been shown to be NP-hard. Thus, to obtain sparse strategies in practice, one either has to apply some heuristics, or use some exhaustive search technique, like ILP (integer linear programming) solving. In this paper, we perform a comparative study of currently available methods to obtain sparse winning strategies for the safety player in safety games. We consider techniques from common knowledge, such as using ILP or SAT (satisfiability) solving, and a novel technique based on iterative linear programming.

We prove that the question of synchronizability becomes undecidable even when looking at deterministic one-counter automata. This is also true for another classical mild extension of regularity, namely that of deterministic one-turn push-down automata. However, when we combine both restrictions, we arrive at scenarios with a PSPACE-complete (and hence decidable) synchronizability problem. Likewise, we arrive at a decidable synchronizability problem for (partially) blind deterministic counter automata. \nThere are several interpretations of what synchronizability should mean for deterministic push-down automata. This is depending on the role of the stack: should it be empty on synchronization, should it be always the same or is it arbitrary?

Optimization is one form of analysis. We argue that in many cases it may be better to replace the optimization problem with the satisficing problem, where instead of searching for optimal solutions, the goal is to search for solutions that adhere to a given threshold bound. This work defines and investigates the satisficing problem on a two-player graph game with the discounted-sum cost model. We show that while the satisficing problem can be solved using numerical methods just like the optimization problem, this approach does not render compelling benefits over optimization. When the discount factor is, however, an integer, we present another approach to satisficing, which is purely based on automata methods.

They provide a simple formalism to specify the behaviour of reactive systems operating over data \u03c9-words. We study the synthesis problem for specifications given as register automata over a linearly ordered data domain (e.g. (N, \u2264) or (Q, \u2264)), which allow for comparison of data with regards to the linear order. To that end, we extend the classical Church synthesis game to infinite alphabets: two players, Adam and Eve, alternately play some data, and Eve wins whenever their interaction complies with the specification, which is a language of \u03c9-words over ordered data. Such games are however undecidable, even when the specification is recognised by a deterministic register automaton. This is in contrast with the equality case, where the problem is only undecidable for nondeterministic and universal specifications. Thus, we study one-sided Church games, where Eve instead operates over a finite alphabet, while Adam still manipulates data. We show they are determined, and deciding the existence of a winning strategy is in ExpTime, both for Q and N. This follows from a study of constraint sequences, which abstract the behaviour of register automata, and allow us to reduce Church games to \u03c9-regular games. Lastly, we apply these results to the transducer synthesis problem for input-driven register automata, where each output data is restricted to be the content of some register, and show that if there exists an implementation, then there exists one which is a register transducer. 2012 ACM Subject Classification Theory of computation \u2192 Logic and verification; Theory of computation \u2192 Automata over infinite objects; Theory of computation \u2192 Transducers", "venue": "STACS", "authors": ["L'eo  Exibard", "Emmanuel  Filiot", "Ayrat  Khalimov"], "year": 2021, "n_citations": 5}

We study window parity objectives in timed automata and timed games: given a bound on the window size, a path satisfies such an objective if, in all states along the path, we see a sufficiently small window in which the smallest priority is even. We show that checking that all time-divergent paths of a timed automaton satisfy such a window parity objective can be done in polynomial space, and that the corresponding timed games can be solved in exponential time. This matches the complexity class of timed parity games, while adding the ability to reason about time bounds.

In 1978, Sakoda and Sipser posed the question of the costs, in the number of the states, of the simulations of one-way and two-way non-deterministic automata by two-way deterministic automata. They conjectured that these costs are exponential. In spite of all attempts to solve it, this question is still open. In the last ten years the problem of Sakoda and Sipser was widely reconsidered and many new results related to it have been obtained. In this work we discuss some of them.

Jurdzinski and Morvan (2020) have recently brought forward a generic attractor-based algorithm, formalizing a second class of quasi-polynomial solutions to solving parity games, which have runtime quadratic in the size of universal trees.

By carefully integrating these structural features in IC3PO, a novel model checking algorithm, we were able to infer an inductive invariant that identically matches the human-written one previously derived with significant manual effort using interactive theorem proving. While various attempts have been made to verify different versions of Paxos, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of an automatically-inferred inductive invariant for Lamport\u2019s original Paxos specification.

Despite their simplicity, the induced global dynamic produces a stunning array of richly-structured, complex behaviors. These behaviors present a challenge to traditional closed-form analytic methods. In certain cases, specifically when the local update is additive, powerful techniques may be brought to bear, including characteristic polynomials, the ergodic theorem with Fourier analysis, and endomorphisms of compact Abelian groups. For general dynamics, though, where such analytics generically do not apply, behavior-driven analysis shows great promise in directly monitoring the emergence of structure and complexity in cellular automata.

Weighted finite automata (WFA) are closely related to the theory of rational series. A rational series is a function from strings to real numbers that can be computed by a WFA. Among others, this includes probability distributions generated by hidden Markov models and probabilistic automata. The relationship between rational series and WFA is analogous to the relationship between regular languages and ordinary automata. Associated with such rational series are infinite matrices called Hankel matrices which play a fundamental role in the theory of minimal WFA. Our contributions are: (1) an effective procedure for computing the singular value decomposition (SVD) of such infinite Hankel matrices based on their finite representation in terms of WFA, (2) a new canonical form for WFA based on this SVD decomposition, and, (3) an algorithm to construct approximate minimizations of a given WFA. The goal of our approximate minimization algorithm is to start from a minimal WFA and produce a smaller WFA that is close to the given one in a certain sense. The desired size of the approximating automaton is given as input. We give bounds describing how well the approximation emulates the behavior of the original WFA. The study of this problem is motivated by the analysis of machine learning algorithms that synthesize weighted automata from spectral decompositions of finite Hankel matrices. It is known that when the number of states of the target automaton is correctly guessed, these algorithms enjoy consistency and finite-sample guarantees in the probably approximately correct (PAC) learning model.

In such schemes, a computational process is responsible for signaling an end of a calculation by setting a halt bit, which needs to be systematically checked by an observer. The capacity of quantum computational models to operate on a superposition of states requires an alternative approach. From a quantum perspective, any measurement of an equivalent halt qubit would have the potential to inherently interfere with the computation by provoking a random collapse amongst the states. This issue is exacerbated by undecidable problems such as the Entscheidungsproblem which require universal computational models, e.g. the classical Turing machine, to be able to proceed indefinitely. In this work we present an alternative view of quantum computation based on production system theory in conjunction with Grover's amplitude amplification scheme that allows for (1) a detection of halt states without interfering with the final result of a computation; (2) the possibility of non-terminating computation and (3) an inherent speedup to occur during computations susceptible of parallelization.

Since trace inclusion relations are themselves PSPACE-complete, we introduce lookahead simulations as good polynomial time computable approximations thereof. Extensive experiments show that the average-case time complexity of our algorithms scales slightly above quadratically. (The space complexity is worst-case quadratic.) The size reduction of the automata depends very much on the class of instances, but our algorithm consistently reduces the size far more than all previous techniques.

We test the method to provide evidence in favour of a conjecture concerning the computing capabilities of Busy Beaver Turing machines as candidates for Turing universality. The method has recently been used to quantify the number of intrinsically universal cellular automata, with results that point towards the pervasiveness of universality due to a widespread capacity for emulation. Our method represents an unconventional approach to the classical and seminal concept of Turing universality, and it may be extended and applied in a broader context to natural computation, by (in something like the spirit of the Turing test) observing the behaviour of a system under circumstances where formal proofs of universality are difficult, if not impossible to come by.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Hector  Zenil", "J\u00fcrgen  Riedel"], "year": 2016, "n_citations": 4}

In our setting, a safe behaviour is characterised by a NetKAT policy, or program, which does not enable forwarding packets from an ingress i to an undesirable egress e. We show how explanations for safety violations can be derived in an equational fashion, according to a modification of the existing NetKAT axiomatisation. We propose an approach based on the Maude system for actually computing the undesired behaviours witnessing the forwarding of packets from i to e as above. SDN-SafeCheck is a tool based on Maude equational theories satisfying important properties such as Church-Rosser and termination.

In this paper, we describe a novel FPGA architecture for RE matching that is able to process network traffic beyond 100 Gbps. The key idea is to reduce the required FPGA resources by leveraging approximate nondeterministic FAs (NFAs). The NFAs are compiled into a multi-stage architecture starting with the least precise stage with a high throughput and ending with the most precise stage with a low throughput.

Therefore, given a monoid $M$, it is natural to ask how long a sequence of elements of $M$ needs to be to ensure the presence of consecutive idempotent factors. This question is formalised through the notion of the Ramsey function $R_M$ associated to M, obtained by mapping every positive integer $k$ to the minimal integer $R_M(k)$ such that every word $u$ in $M^*$ of length $R_M(k)$ contains $k$ consecutive non-empty factors that correspond to the same idempotent element of $M$. \nIn this work, we study the behaviour of the Ramsey function $R_M$ by investigating the regular $D$-length of $M$, defined as the largest size $L(M)$ of a submonoid of $M$ isomorphic to the set of natural numbers $\\{1,2, ..., L(M)\\}$ equipped with the Max operation.

One of the most popular constructions, due to Glushkov and to McNaughton and Yamada, is based on the computation of the Null, First, Last and Follow sets (called Glushkov functions) associated with a linearized version of the expression. Recently Mignot considered a family of extended expressions called Extended to multi-tilde-bar Regular Expressions (EmtbREs) and he showed that, under some restrictions, Glushkov functions can be defined for an EmtbRE. In this paper we present an algorithm which efficiently computes the Glushkov functions of an unrestricted EmtbRE. Our approach is based on a recursive definition of the language associated with an EmtbRE which enlightens the fact that the worst case time complexity of the conversion of an EmtbRE into an automaton is related to the worst case time complexity of the computation of the Null function. Finally we show how to extend the ZPC -structure to EmtbREs, which allows us to apply to this family of extended expressions the efficient constructions based on this structure (in particular the construction of the c-continuation automaton, the position automaton, the follow automaton and the equation automaton).", "venue": "J.

The corresponding class of additive regular functions has multiple equivalent characterizations, appealing closure properties, and a decidable equivalence problem. In this paper, we solve two decision problems for this model. First, we define the register complexity of an additive regular function to be the minimum number of registers that an ACRA needs to compute it. We characterize the register complexity by a necessary and sufficient condition regarding the largest subset of registers whose values can be made far apart from one another. We then use this condition to design a pspace algorithm to compute the register complexity of a given ACRA, and establish a matching lower bound. Our results also lead to a machine-independent characterization of the register complexity of additive regular functions. Second, we consider two-player games over ACRAs, where the objective of one of the players is to reach a target set while minimizing the cost. We show the corresponding decision problem to be exptime-complete when the costs are non-negative integers, but undecidable when the costs are integers.", "venue": "ICALP", "authors": ["Rajeev  Alur", "Mukund  Raghothaman"], "year": 2013, "n_citations": 23}

Characterizing conditions in terms of coverings is significant because it connects the field with a vast body of classical literature in graph theory and algebraic topology.

Combined together, these tools allow us to present elegant proofs of otherwise intricate results, and their constructive nature makes them effectively usable in the algorithms.

Meanwhile, we anticipate that the functionalities would remain consistent following the modifications. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm to automatically produce specification revisions tackling the attack scenarios caused by weakened user obligations. By our algorithm, all the revisions would be generated to maintain the integrity of the functionalities using a novel recomposition approach.

IntroductionThe main issue in supervisory control of discrete-event systems [1] is the state-space explo-sion problem inherent to large systems, which makes the standard techniques that compute anduse the whole system model very di\ufb03cult and often impossible to use. Methods how to decreasethe complexity are intensively studied in the literature. Modular control and hierarchical controlare the most successful approaches known so far. These two approaches are complementary be-cause the modular approach can be understood as a horizontal modularity, while the hierarchicalapproach can be understood as a vertical modularity. The best known results are achieved whenthe two approaches are combined [2].During the last few decades, hierarchical control of discrete-event systems with completeobservations has widely been investigated. Several important concepts\u2014the observer property[3], output control consistency (OCC) [4], and local control consistency (LCC) [5]\u2014have beenproposed and studied. These concepts are su\ufb03cient conditions for the high-level synthesis ofa nonblocking and optimal supervisor having a low-level implementation.

In this model, there is an oracle, called the Teacher, that can answer membership and equivalence queries posed by the Learner. Motivated by this feature, we first characterise the complexity of the equivalence problem for multiplicity tree automata, showing that it is logspace equivalent to polynomial identity testing. \n \nWe then move to query complexity, deriving lower bounds on the number of queries needed to learn multiplicity tree automata over both fixed and arbitrary fields. In the latter case, the bound is linear in the size of the target automaton. The best known upper bound on the query complexity over arbitrary fields derives from an algorithm of Habrard and Oncina (2006), in which the number of queries is proportional to the size of the target automaton and the size of a largest counterexample, represented as a tree, that is returned by the Teacher. However, a smallest counterexample tree may already be exponential in the size of the target automaton. Thus the above algorithm has query complexity exponentially larger than our lower bound, and does not run in time polynomial in the size of the target automaton. \n \nWe give a new learning algorithm for multiplicity tree automata in which counterexamples to equivalence queries are represented as DAGs. The query complexity of this algorithm is quadratic in the target automaton size and linear in the size of a largest counterexample.

The smallest number of edges in a rectifier network computing $M$ is a classic complexity measure on matrices, which has been studied for more than half a century. \nWe explore two well-known techniques that have hitherto found little to no applications in this theory. Both of them build on a basic fact that depth-$2$ rectifier networks are essentially weighted coverings of Boolean matrices with rectangles. We obtain new results by using fractional and greedy coverings (defined in the standard way). \nFirst, we show that all fractional coverings of the so-called full triangular matrix have cost at least $n\\log n$. This provides (a fortiori) a new proof of the tight lower bound on its depth-$2$ complexity (the exact value has been known since 1965, but previous proofs are based on different arguments). Second, we show that the greedy heuristic is instrumental in tightening the upper bound on the depth-$2$ complexity of the Kneser-Sierpinski (disjointness) matrix. The previous upper bound is $O(n^{1.28})$, and we improve it to $O(n^{1.17})$, while the best known lower bound is $\\Omega(n^{1.16})$. Third, using fractional coverings, we obtain a form of direct product theorem that gives a lower bound on unbounded-depth complexity of Kronecker (tensor) products of matrices. In this case, the greedy heuristic shows (by an argument due to Lovasz) that our result is only a logarithmic factor away from the \"full\" direct product theorem.

This definition enables the representation of this set, whenever the closed form of the relation of the loop is definable in a logic that has quantifier elimination. This entails the decidability of the termination problem for such loops. Second, we present effective ways to compute the weakest precondition for non-termination for difference bounds and octagonal (non-deterministic) relations, by avoiding complex quantifier eliminations. We also investigate the existence of linear ranking functions for such loops.

Since linear/additive CA refer a limited number of candidate CA, while searching for solution to a problem, the best result may not be expected. The nonlinear CA can be a better alternative to linear/additive CA for achieving desired solutions in different applications. However, the nonlinear CA are yet to be characterized to fit the design for modeling an application. This work targets characterization of the nonlinear CA to utilize the huge search space of nonlinear CA while developing applications in VLSI domain.

The characterization is directed to deal with the reversibility, as the reversible CA are primarily targeted for VLSI applications.

A striking example is the reachability problem for three-dimensional VASSes (3-VASSes): it is only known to be PSpace-hard and not known to be elementary. One possible approach which turned out to be successful for many VASS subclasses is to prove that to check reachability it suffices to inspect only runs of some bounded length. This approach however has its limitations, it is usually hard to design an algorithm substantially faster than the possible size of finite reachability sets in that VASS subclass. In 2010 Leroux has proven that non-reachability between two configurations implies separability of the source from target by some semilinear set, which is an inductive invariant. There can be a reasonable hope that it suffices to look for separators of bounded size, which would deliver an efficient algorithm for VASS reachability. In the paper we show that in VASSes fulfilling certain conditions existence of only long runs between some configurations implies existence of only big separators between some other configurations (and in a slightly modified VASS). Additionally we prove that a few known examples of hard VASSes fulfil the mentioned conditions. Therefore improving the complexity of the reachability problem (for any subclass) using the separators approach can meet serious obstacles. 2012 ACM Subject Classification Theory of computation \u2192 Parallel computing models", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Wojciech  Czerwinski", "Adam  Jedrych"], "year": 2021, "n_citations": 0}

We show that many interesting correctness properties can be formulated in this way, examples being safety, liveness, bisimilarity, and games. More importantly, we show that this new formulation allows new interesting benchmarks (and old regular model checking benchmarks that were previously believed to be difficult), especially in the domain of parameterized system verification, to be solved.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Anthony Widjaja Lin", "Philipp  R\u00fcmmer"], "year": 2020, "n_citations": 0}

Departing from the traditional way of presenting as independent algorithms the deterministic bottom-up LR(1), the top-down LL(1) and the general tabular (Earley) parsers, we unify them in a coherent minimalist framework. We present a simple general construction method for EBNF ELR(1) parsers, where the new category of convergence conflicts is added to the classical shift-reduce and reduce-reduce conflicts; we prove its correctness and show two implementations by deterministic push-down machines and by vector-stack machines, the latter to be also used for Earley parsers. Then the Beatty's theoretical characterization of LL(1) grammars is adapted to derive the extended ELL(1 parsing method, first by minimizing the ELR(1) parser and then by simplifying its state information. Through using the same notations in the ELR(1) case, the extended Earley parser is obtained.

By modeling the system as a probabilistic labeled Markov decision process (PL-MDP), the control objective is to synthesize a finite-memory policy, under which the agent satisfies high-level complex tasks expressed as linear temporal logic (LTL) with desired satisfaction probability. In particular, the cost optimization of the trajectory that satisfies infinite-horizon tasks is considered, and the trade-off between reducing the expected mean cost and maximizing the probability of task satisfaction is analyzed. Instead of using traditional Rabin automata, the LTL formulas are converted to limit-deterministic B\u00fcchi automata (LDBA) with a more straightforward accepting condition and a more compact graph structure. The novelty of this work lies in the consideration of the cases that LTL specifications can be potentially infeasible and the development of a relaxed product MDP between PL-MDP and LDBA. The relaxed product MDP allows the agent to revise its motion plan whenever the task is not fully feasible and to quantify the violation measurement of the revised plan. A multi-objective optimization problem is then formulated to jointly consider the probability of the task satisfaction, the violation with respect to original task constraints, and the implementation cost of the policy execution, which is solved via coupled linear programs. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work that bridges the gap between planning revision and optimal control synthesis of both plan prefix and plan suffix of the agent trajectory over the infinite horizon.

The quotient complexity of a regular language $L$ is the number of left quotients of $L$; this is the same as the state complexity of $L$. A regular language $L'$ is a dialect of a regular language $L$ if it differs only slightly from $L$. The quotient complexity of an operation on regular languages is the maximal quotient complexity of the result of the operation expressed as a function of the quotient complexities of the operands. A sequence $(L_k,L_{k+1},\\dots)$ of regular languages in some class ${\\mathcal C}$, where $n$ is the quotient complexity of $L_n$, is called a stream. A stream is most complex in class ${\\mathcal C}$ if its languages $L_n$ meet the complexity upper bounds for all basic measures. It is known that there exist such most complex streams in the class of regular languages, in the class of prefix-free languages, and also in the classes of right, left, and two-sided ideals. In contrast to this, we prove that there does not exist a most complex stream in the class of suffix-free regular languages. However, we do exhibit one ternary suffix-free stream that meets the bound for product and whose restrictions to binary alphabets meet the bounds for star and boolean operations. We also exhibit a quinary stream that meets the bounds for boolean operations, reversal, size of syntactic semigroup, and atom complexities.

We parameterize the problem with two parameters: the size of the thread pool as well as the number of context switches for each task. The size of the thread pool determines the number of workers running concurrently. The number of context switches determines howmany times a worker can be swapped out while executing a single task\u2014like many verification problems for multithreaded recursive programs, the context bounding is important for decidability. We show that the safety verification problem for thread-pooled, context-bounded, Boolean programs is EXPSPACE-complete, even if the size of the thread pool and the context bound are given in binary.

However, these methods rely on the assumed structure and probabilities of certain system transitions. These assumptions may be incorrect, and may even be violated in the event that an adversary gains control of some or all components in the system. In this paper, motivated by research in adversarial machine learning on adversarial examples, we develop a formal framework for adversarial robustness in systems defined as discrete time Markov chains (DTMCs). We base our framework on existing probabilistic verification frameworks for probabilistic temporal logic properties. We also extend our framework to include deterministic, memoryless policies acting in Markov decision processes (MDPs). Our framework includes a flexible approach for specifying several adversarial models with different capabilities to manipulate the system. We outline a class of threat models under which adversaries can perturb system transitions, constrained by an \u03b5 ball around the original transition probabilities and define four specific instances of this threat model. Notably, we consider the situation where the adversary can only modify transitions which existed in the original DTMC, as well as the more powerful case where the adversary can modify the structure of the DTMC by adding transitions. We define three main DTMC adversarial robustness problems: adversarial robustness verification, maximal \u03b4 synthesis, and worst case attack synthesis. We present two optimizationbased solutions to these three problems, leveraging traditional and parametric probabilistic model checking techniques. We then evaluate our solutions on two stochastic protocols and a collection of GridWorld case studies, which model an agent acting in an environment described as an MDP. We find that the parametric solution results in fast computation for small parameter spaces. In the case of less restrictive (stronger) adversaries, the number of parameters increases, and directly computing property satisfaction probabilities is more scalable.

This question has been investigated using tools from combinatorics, dynamic programming, and graph theory, and has practical applications in Bayesian phylogenetics. In this work, we revisit this theoretical question from a different point of view, based on linear algebra. The main contribution is a set of results based on this linear algebra view that facilitate the analysis and design of inference algorithms on string-valued graphical models.

Compared to previous work, our proving method is easier to extend to other models, since it relies on a novel weak condition, triangular transducers, which is easy to establish in practice. The linear algebra view provides a concise way of describing transducer algorithms and their compositions, opens the possibility of transferring fast linear algebra libraries (for example, based on GPUs), as well as low rank matrix approximation methods, to string-valued inference problems.", "venue": "Bulletin of mathematical biology", "authors": ["Alexandre  Bouchard-C\u00f4t\u00e9"], "year": 2013, "n_citations": 10}

Current software systems of formal language objects do not have a mechanism to define such objects. We define transducers in which transition labels involve what we call set specifications, some of which are alphabet invariant. In fact, we give a more broad definition of automata-type objects, called labelled graphs, where each transition label can be any string, as long as that string represents a subset of a certain monoid. Then, the behaviour of the labelled graph is a subset of that monoid. We do the same for regular expressions. We obtain extensions of a few classic algorithmic constructions on ordinary regular expressions and transducers at the broad level of labelled graphs and in such a way that the computational efficiency of the extended constructions is not sacrificed. For regular expressions with set specs we obtain the corresponding partial derivative automata. For transducers with set specs we obtain further algorithms that can be applied to questions about independent regular languages, in particular the witness version of the independent property satisfaction question.", "venue": "CIAA", "authors": ["Stavros  Konstantinidis", "Nelma  Moreira", "Rog\u00e9rio  Reis", "Joshua  Young"], "year": 2018, "n_citations": 2}

Synthesizing correct-by-design control laws is a challenging task resulting in computationally demanding methods. We consider efficient automata-based planning for continuous-time systems under signal interval temporal logic specifications, an expressive fragment of signal temporal logic. The planning is based on recent results for automata-based verification of metric interval temporal logic. A timed signal transducer is obtained accepting all Boolean signals that satisfy a metric interval temporal logic specification, which is abstracted from the signal interval temporal logic specification at hand. This transducer is modified to account for the spatial properties of the signal interval temporal logic specification, characterizing all real-valued signals that satisfy this specification. Using logic-based feedback control laws, such as the ones we have presented in earlier works, we then provide an abstraction of the system that, in a suitable way, aligns with the modified timed signal transducer. This allows to avoid the state space explosion that is typically induced by forming a product automaton between an abstraction of the system and the specification.", "venue": "2020 American Control Conference (ACC)", "authors": ["Lars  Lindemann", "Dimos V.

In particular it is shown that a function is automatic iff there is a one-tape Turing machine with a left end which computes the function in linear time where the input before the computation and the output after the computation both start at the left end. It is known that learners realised as automatic update functions are restrictive for learning. In the present work it is shown that one can overcome the problem by providing work tapes additional to a resource-bounded base tape while keeping the update-time to be linear in the length of the largest datum seen so far. In this model, one additional such work tape provides additional learning power over the automatic learner model and two additional work tapes give full learning power.

A word of length n can contain at most \u0398 ( n 2 ) distinct factors, and there exist words of length n containing \u0398 ( n 2 ) distinct abelian-square factors, that is, distinct factors that are abelian squares. This motivates us to study infinite words such that the number of distinct abelian-square factors of length n grows quadratically with n . More precisely, we say that an infinite word w is abelian-square-rich if, for every n , every factor of w of length n contains, on average, a number of distinct abelian-square factors that is quadratic in n ; and uniformly abelian-square-rich if every factor of w contains a number of distinct abelian-square factors that is proportional to the square of its length. Of course, if a word is uniformly abelian-square-rich, then it is abelian-square-rich, but we show that the converse is not true in general. We prove that the Thue\u2013Morse word is uniformly abelian-square-rich and that the function counting the number of distinct abelian-square factors of length 2 n of the Thue\u2013Morse word is 2-regular. As for Sturmian words, we prove that a Sturmian word s \u03b1 of angle \u03b1 is uniformly abelian-square-rich if and only if the irrational \u03b1 has bounded partial quotients, that is, if and only if s \u03b1 has bounded exponent.", "venue": "Theor.

In this paper, we focus on the complementary idea: how two sequences can be efficiently compared based on information that does not occur in the sequences. A word is an absent word of some sequence if it does not occur in the sequence. An absent word is minimal if all its proper factors occur in the sequence. Here we present the first linear-time and linear-space algorithm to compare two sequences by considering all their minimal absent words. In the process, we present results of combinatorial interest, and also extend the proposed techniques to compare circular sequences.

Method: The two algorithms proposed are formalized. The completeness of the first algorithm and the minimality of the second algorithm are formally proven. Both algorithms together with other three state-of-the-art algorithms have been implemented and integrated into a single tool so that we have been able to carry out a fair empirical evaluation.

Conclusions: The first algorithm collects all places and transitions that may influence (in any computation) the slicing criterion, while the second algorithm collects a minimum set of places and transitions that may influence (in some computation) the slicing criterion. Therefore, the net computed by the first algorithm can reproduce any computation that contributes tokens to any place of interest.

However, it becomes undecidable for both deterministic pushdown automata (with no reversal-bound), and for nondeterministic one-counter automata. When examining suffix-density, it is undecidable for more restricted families such as deterministic one-counter automata that make three reversals on the counter, but it is decidable with less reversals. Other decidability results are also presented on dense languages, and contrasted with a marked version called \\(\\varrho \\)-marked-density. Also, new languages are demonstrated to be outside various deterministic language families after applying different deletion operations from smaller families.

Such formalisms are highly expressive, but also undecidable, and few decidable subclasses were proposed. We propose here a syntactic restriction on PTAs consisting in removing guards (constraints on transitions) to keep only invariants (constraints on locations). While this restriction preserves the expressiveness of PTAs (and therefore their undecidability), an additional restriction on the type of constraints allows to not only prove decidability, but also to perform the exact synthesis of parameter valuations satisfying reachability. This formalism, that seems trivial at first sight as it benefits from the decidability of the reachability problem with a better complexity than Timed Automata (TAs), suffers from the undecidability of the whole TCTL logic that TAs, on the contrary enjoy.

In particular, we show that the genus size |L|gen can grow at least exponentially in size |L|. We conjecture, however, the genus of every regular language to be computable. This conjecture implies in particular that the planarity of a regular language is decidable, a question asked in 1976 by R. V. Book and A. K. Chandra.

By adding parameterized operators to LDL, we obtain a logic that is able to express all omega-regular properties and that subsumes parameterized extensions of LTL like Parametric LTL and PROMPT-LTL. \nOur main technical contribution is a translation of PLDL formulas into non-deterministic Buchi automata of exponential size via alternating automata. This yields polynomial space algorithms for model checking and assume-guarantee model checking and a realizability algorithm with doubly-exponential running time. All three problems are also shown to be complete for these complexity classes. Moreover, we give tight upper and lower bounds on optimal parameter values for model checking and realizability. Using these bounds, we present a polynomial space procedure for model checking optimization and an algorithm with triply-exponential running time for realizability optimization. Our results show that PLDL model checking and realizability are no harder than their respective (parametric) LTL counterparts.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Peter  Faymonville", "Martin  Zimmermann"], "year": 2015, "n_citations": 3}

To this end, safety engineers rely during the development phase on architectural solutions, called safety patterns, such as safety monitors, voters, and watchdogs. The goal of these patterns is to control (identified) faults that can trigger hazards. Safety patterns can control such faults by e.g., increasing the redundancy of the system. Currently, the reasoning of which pattern to use at which part of the target system to control which hazard is documented mostly in textual form or by means of models, such as GSN-models, with limited support for automation. This paper proposes the use of logic programming engines for the automated reasoning about system safety. We propose a domain-specific language for embedded system safety and specify as disjunctive logic programs reasoning principles used by safety engineers to deploy safety patterns, e.g., when to use safety monitors, or watchdogs. Our machinery enables two types of automated safety reasoning: (1) identification of which hazards can be controlled and which ones cannot be controlled by the existing safety patterns; and (2) automated recommendation of which patterns could be used at which place of the system to control potential hazards.

The notion of an abelian closure gives a characterization of Sturmian words: among uniformly recurrent binary words, periodic and aperiodic Sturmian words are exactly those words for which A(x) equals the shift orbit closure \u03a9(x). Furthermore, for an aperiodic binary word that is not Sturmian, its abelian closure contains infinitely many minimial subshifts. In this paper we consider the abelian closures of well-known families of non-binary words, such as balanced words and minimal complexity words. We also consider abelian closures of general subshifts and make some initial observations of their abelian closures and pose some related open questions.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Juhani  Karhum\u00e4ki", "Svetlana  Puzynina", "Markus A.

The advantage concerned in this paper attempts to address the need for memory resources during the simulation of systems by cellular-DEVS. This improvement of performance is based on the usage of the property closure under coupling in the DEVS formalism. With this property and taking account of the iterative behavior of each cellular-DEVS atomic model, we provide simulation of many models simultaneously. The method starts with the specification of the cellular-DEVS coupled model which is then converted into its equivalent DEVS atomic model. Thus, the goal of this conversion is to transform large quantities of atomic models coupled together, which require huge computational resources, into one DEVS atomic model. A case study is presented at the end of the work on modeling and simulation of forest fire propagation using DEVS and cellular-DEVS. A specification by cellular-DEVS of the forest fire model and its non-modular equivalent DEVS atomic model are presented.

Like Lechner et al., we rely on a reduction to the reachability problem in OCA with parameterized tests (OCA(P)). The new aspect is that we simulate OCA(P) by alternating two-way automata over words. This implies an exponential upper bound on the parameter values that we exploit towards an NP algorithm for reachability in OCA(P) with unary updates. We obtain our main result as a corollary.

We present a holistic safety concept unifying advanced safety measures for handling multiple-point faults. Our proposed approach enables designers to focus on more pressing issues such as handling fault-free hazardous behavior associated with system performance limitations. To verify our approach, we developed an executable model of the safety concept in the formal specification language mCRL2. The model behavior is governed by a four-mode degradation policy controlling distributed processors, redundant communication networks, and virtual machines. To keep the vehicle as safe as possible our degradation policy can reduce driving comfort or AD system's availability using additional low-cost driving channels. We formalized five safety requirements in the modal mu-calculus and proved them against our mCRL2 model, which is intractable to accomplish exhaustively using traditional road tests or simulation techniques.

In particular, we define two quotient operations for formal power series that coincide when calculated by a word. We term the first operation as (left or right) \\emph{quotient}, and the second as (left or right) \\emph{residual}. To support the definitions of quotients and residuals, the underlying semiring is restricted to complete semirings or complete c-semirings. Algebraical properties that are similar to the classical case are obtained in the formal power series case. Moreover, we show closure properties, under quotients and residuals, of regular series and weighted context-free series are similar as in formal languages. Using these operations, we define for each formal power series $A$ two weighted automata ${\\cal M}_A$ and ${\\cal U}_A$. Both weighted automata accepts $A$, and ${\\cal M}_A$ is the minimal deterministic weighted automaton of $A$.

Evaluation Complexity", "abstract": "Designing query languages for graph structured data is an active field of research, where expressiveness and efficient algorithms for query evaluation are conflicting goals. To better handle dynamically changing data, recent work has been done on designing query languages that can compare values stored in the graph database, without hard coding the values in the query. The main idea is to allow variables in the query and bind the variables to values when evaluating the query. For query languages that bind variables only once, query evaluation is usually NP-complete. There are query languages that allow binding inside the scope of Kleene star operators, which can themselves be in the scope of bindings and so on. Uncontrolled nesting of binding and iteration within one another results in query evaluation being PSPACE-complete. \nWe define a way to syntactically control the nesting depth of iterated bindings, and study how this affects expressiveness and efficiency of query evaluation. The result is an infinite, syntactically defined hierarchy of expressions. We prove that the corresponding language hierarchy is strict. Given an expression in the hierarchy, we prove that it is undecidable to check if there is a language equivalent expression at lower levels. We prove that evaluating a query based on an expression at level i can be done in $\\Sigma_i$ in the polynomial time hierarchy. Satisfiability of quantified Boolean formulas can be reduced to query evaluation; we study the relationship between alternations in Boolean quantifiers and the depth of nesting of iterated bindings.", "venue": "ICALP", "authors": ["M.

Our main result shows that context-bounded fair termination is decidable for the model; context-bounded implies that each spawned thread can be context switched a fixed constant number of times. Our proof is technical, since fair termination requires reasoning about the composition of unboundedly many threads each with unboundedly large stacks. In fact, techniques for related problems, which depend crucially on replacing the pushdown threads with finite-state threads, are not applicable. Instead, we introduce an extension of vector addition systems with states (VASS), called VASS with balloons (VASSB), as an intermediate model; it is an infinite-state model of independent interest. A VASSB allows tokens that are themselves markings (balloons). We show that context bounded fair termination reduces to fair termination for VASSB. We show the latter problem is decidable by showing a series of reductions: from fair termination to configuration reachability for VASSB and thence to the reachability problem for VASS. For a lower bound, fair termination is known to be non-elementary already in the special case where threads run to completion (no context switches).

With quantitative languages, systems and specifications can be formalized more accurately. For example, a system may use a varying amount of some resource (e.g., memory consumption, or power consumption) depending on its behavior, and a specification may assign a maximal amount of available resource to each behavior, or fix the long-run average available use of the resource. \n \nMean-payoff automata are finite automata with numerical weights on transitions that assign to each infinite path the long-run average of the transition weights. Mean-payoff automata forms a class of quantitative languages that is not robust, since it is not closed under the basic algebraic operations: min, max, sum and numerical complement. The class of mean-payoff automaton expressions, recently introduced by Chatterjee et al., is currently the only known class of quantitative languages that is robust, expressive and decidable. This class is defined as the closure of mean-payoff automata under the basic algebraic operations.

Certificates generated by Prover are minimal DFAs. Certificates generated by Refuter are faulty attempts to define the required DFA. We compare the length of offline certificates, which are generated with no interaction between Prover and Refuter, and online certificates, which are based on such an interaction, and are thus shorter. We show that our approach is useful also for certification of separability of regular languages by a DFA of a given size. Unlike DFA minimization, which can be solved in polynomial time, separation is NP-complete, and thus the certification approach is essential.

After we introduce and justify the the notion of the genus for regular languages, the following questions are addressed. First, depending on the size of the alphabet, we provide upper and lower bounds on the genus of regular languages: we show that under a relatively generic condition on the alphabet and the geometry of the automata, the genus grows at least linearly in terms of the size of the automata.

This improves the state of the art Streett determinization construction with n5n(n!)n+1 states, O(n2) Rabin pairs and n5nknkn! states, O(nk) Rabin pairs, respectively.

Connecting subsystems modeled using finite automata into a network allows for more computational power. One such network, called a cellular automaton, consists of an n-dimensional array for n > 1 with a single finite automaton located at each point of the array. One of the oldest problems associated with cellular automata is the firing synchronization problem, originally proposed by John Myhill in 1957. As with any long-standing problem, there are a large number of solutions to the firing synchronization problem. Our goal, and the contribution of this work, is to summarize recent solutions to the problem. We focus primarily on solutions to the original problem, that is, the problem where the network is a one-dimensional array and there is a single initiator located at one of the ends. We summarize both minimal-time and non-minimal-time solutions, with an emphasis on solutions that were published after 1998. We also focus on solutions that minimize the number of states required by the finite automata.

There are two challenges with these approaches: (1) The verification of such systems is difficult and time consuming. (2) These verified controllers are not able to adapt to frequent requirements changes, which are typical in situations like autonomous driving. This raises the question: how can trained and verified controllers, which have gone through expensive training and verification processes, be re-used to deal with requirement changes? This paper addresses this challenge for the first time by proposing a new framework that is capable of dealing with requirement changes at runtime through a mechanism we term runtime interchange. Our approach functions via a continual exchange and selection process of multiple pre-verified controllers. It represents a key step on the way to componentoriented engineering for intelligent designs, as it preserves the behaviours of the original controllers while introducing additional functionality.

Namely, given a parametric specification with multiple parameters, our solution can automatically infer the ranges of parameters for which the property does not hold on the system. In this paper, we consider parametric specifications in metric or Signal Temporal Logic (MTL or STL). Using robust semantics for MTL, the parameter mining problem can be converted into a Pareto optimization problem for which we can provide an approximate solution by utilizing stochastic optimization methods.

Those objectives offer powerful abstraction mechanisms and often yield nice properties such as memoryless determinacy. However, their very nature provides no guarantee on time bounds within which something good can be witnessed. In this work, we consider two approaches toward inclusion of time bounds in parity games. The first one, parity-response games, is based on the notion of finitary parity games [CHH09] and parity games with costs [FZ14,WZ16]. The second one, window parity games, is inspired by window mean-payoff games [CDRR15]. We compare the two approaches and show that while they prove to be equivalent in some contexts, window parity games offer a more tractable alternative when the time bound is given as a parameter (P-c. vs. PSPACE-c.). In particular, it provides a conservative approximation of parity games computable in polynomial time. Furthermore, we extend both approaches to the multi-dimension setting.

He was interested in characterizing those regular languages where groups in the syntactic monoid belong to a variety H. On the language side he allowed the operations union, intersection, concatenation and modified Kleene-star involving a mapping of a prefix code of bounded synchronization delay to a group G \u2208H, but no complementation. In our notation, this leads to the language classes SDH(A\u221e). Our main result shows that SDH(A\u221e) coincides with the class of languages having syntactic monoids where all subgroups are in H. We show that this statement holds for all varieties H of finite groups, whereas Schutzenberger proved this result for varieties H containing Abelian groups, only. Our method shows the result for all H simultaneously on finite and infinite words. Furthermore, we introduce the notion of local Rees extension which refers to a restricted type of the classical Rees extension. We give a decomposition of a monoid in terms of its groups and local Rees extensions. This gives a somewhat similar, but simpler decomposition than in the synthesis theorem of Rhodes and Allen.

In particular, we show how to efficiently obtain the distribution of such an algorithm's running time cost for any given pattern in a random text model, which can be quite general, from simple uniform models to higher-order Markov models or hidden Markov models (HMMs). Furthermore, we provide a technique to compute the exact distribution of \\emph{differences} in running time cost of two algorithms. In contrast to previous work, our approach is neither limited to simple text models, nor to asymptotic statements, nor to moment computations such as expectation and variance. Methodically, we use extensions of finite automata which we call deterministic arithmetic automata (DAAs) and probabilistic arithmetic automata (PAAs) [13]. To our knowledge, this is the first time that substring- or suffix-based pattern matching algorithms are analyzed exactly. Experimentally, we compare Horspool's algorithm, Backward DAWG Matching, and Backward Oracle Matching on prototypical patterns of short length and provide statistics on the size of minimal DAAs for these computations.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Tobias  Marschall", "Sven  Rahmann"], "year": 2010, "n_citations": 2}

The counter can be incremented, decremented, or not changed during each state transition, and transitions may be enabled or not depending on both the current state and on whether the counter value is 0 or not. Some states are \"random\", from where the next transition is chosen according to a given probability distribution, while other states are \"controlled\", from where the next transition is chosen by the controller. Different objectives for the controller give rise to different computational problems, aimed at computing optimal achievable objective values and optimal strategies.\n OC-MDPs are in fact equivalent to a controlled extension of (discrete-time) Quasi-Birth-Death processes (QBDs), a purely stochastic model heavily studied in queueing theory and applied probability. They can thus be viewed as a natural \"adversarial\" extension of a classic stochastic model. They can also be viewed as a natural probabilistic/controlled extension of classic one-counter automata. OC-MDPs also subsume (as a very restricted special case) a recently studied MDP model called \"solvency games\" that model a risk-averse gambling scenario.\n Basic computational questions for OC-MDPs include \"termination\" questions and \"limit\" questions, such as the following: does the controller have a strategy to ensure that the counter (which may, for example, count the number of jobs in the queue) will hit value 0 (the empty queue) almost surely (a.s.)? Or that the counter will have lim sup value \u221e, a.s.? Or, that it will hit value 0 in a selected terminal state, a.s.? Or, in case such properties are not satisfied almost surely, compute their optimal probability over all strategies.\n We provide new upper and lower bounds on the complexity of such problems. Specifically, we show that several quantitative and almost-sure limit problems can be answered in polynomial time, and that almost-sure termination problems (without selection of desired terminal states) can also be answered in polynomial time. On the other hand, we show that the almost-sure termination problem with selected terminal states is PSPACE-hard and we provide an exponential time algorithm for this problem. We also characterize classes of strategies that suffice for optimality in several of these settings.\n Our upper bounds combine a number of techniques from the theory of MDP reward models, the theory of random walks, and a variety of automata-theoretic methods.", "venue": "SODA '10", "authors": ["Tom\u00e1s  Br\u00e1zdil", "V\u00e1clav  Brozek", "Kousha  Etessami", "Anton\u00edn  Kucera", "Dominik  Wojtczak"], "year": 2010, "n_citations": 62}

On the other hand, for the case with arbitrary many clocks where only one of these clocks is compared with an arbitrary number of parameters, we show that the parametric language emptiness is decidable. The undecidability result tightens the bounds of a previous result which assumed six parameters, while the decidability result extends the existing approaches that deal with discrete-time semantics only.

Mathematically, the monitoring problem can be formalized as a pattern matching problem against a pattern automaton. Motivated by the needs in embedded applications\u2014especially the limited channel capacity between a sensor unit and a processor that monitors\u2014we pursue the idea of filtering as preprocessing for monitoring. Technically, for a given pattern automaton, we present a construction of a Moore machine that works as a filter. The construction is automata-theoretic, and we find the use of Moore machines particularly suited for embedded applications, not only because their sequential operation is relatively cheap but also because they are amenable to hardware acceleration by dedicated circuits. We prove soundness (i.e., absence of lost matches), too. We work in two settings: in the untimed one, a pattern is an NFA; in the timed one, a pattern is a timed automaton. The extension of our untimed construction to the timed setting is technically involved, but our experiments demonstrate its practical benefits.", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems", "authors": ["Masaki  Waga", "Ichiro  Hasuo"], "year": 2018, "n_citations": 2}

We work with 2-dimensional systems in both models, and for our results we first define what it means for CA systems to simulate aTAM systems, and then for aTAM systems to simulate CA systems.

We also show that several problems which are deceptively simple in the usual definitions, become undecidable when we allow for local probabilistic correlations, even in dimension one. Armed with this formalism, we extend the notion of intrinsic simulation between deterministic cellular automata, to the non-deterministic and stochastic settings. Although the intrinsic simulation relation is shown to become undecidable in dimension two and higher, we provide explicit tools to prove or disprove the existence of such a simulation between any two given stochastic cellular automata. Those tools rely upon a characterization of equality of stochastic global maps, shown to be equivalent to the existence of a stochastic coupling between the random sources.

We define the probability of satisfaction of a linear temporal logic formula given a specific initial state of the agent and true state of the environment. Then, we present an algorithm to construct a Markov chain that represents the system behavior under the composition of the perception and control components such that the probability of the temporal logic formula computed over the Markov chain is consistent with the probability that the temporal logic formula is satisfied by our system. We illustrate this approach on a simple example of a car with pedestrian on the sidewalk environment, and compute the probability of satisfaction of safety requirements for varying parameters of the vehicle. We also illustrate how satisfaction probability changes with varied precision and recall derived from the confusion matrix.

The central problem in TRMC is to decide whether a set of bad states is reachable. The problem of computing a TA representing (an over- approximation of) the set of reachable states is undecidable, but efficient solutions based on completion or iteration of tree transducers exist. Unfortunately, the TRMC framework is unable to efficiently capture both the complex structure of a system and of some of its features. As an example, for JAVA programs, the structure of a term is mainly exploited to capture the structure of a state of the system. On the counter part, integers of the java programs have to be encoded with Peano numbers, which means that any algebraic operation is potentially represented by thousands of applications of rewriting rules. In this paper, we propose Lattice Tree Automata (LTAs), an extended version of tree automata whose leaves are equipped with lattices. LTAs allow us to represent possibly infinite sets of interpreted terms. Such terms are capable to represent complex domains and related operations in an efficient manner. We also extend classical Boolean operations to LTAs.

A main insight is that we can achieve optimal (or near optimal) algorithms with the PG-approach, but the delay for enumeration is rather high (linear in the database).

Acting on infinite words, @j generates the class of standard episturmian words, including standard Arnoux-Rauzy words. In this paper, we generalize the palindromization map, starting with a given code X over A. The new map @j\"X maps X^* to the set PAL of palindromes of A^*. In this way, some properties of @j are lost and some are saved in a weak form. When X has a finite deciphering delay, one can extend @j\"X to X^@w, generating a class of infinite words much wider than standard episturmian words. For a finite and maximal code X over A, we give a suitable generalization of standard Arnoux-Rauzy words, called X-AR words. We prove that any X-AR word is a morphic image of a standard Arnoux-Rauzy word and we determine some suitable linear lower and upper bounds to its factor complexity. For any code X, we say that @j\"X is conservative when @j\"X(X^*)@?X^*. We study conservative maps @j\"X and conditions on X assuring that @j\"X is conservative.

This small syntactic variation induces a logic that can express non-regular properties for which known extensions of MSO with equality of path length are undecidable. We show that our variant of CTL is decidable and that the modelchecking problem is in \u22063 = P NP , and is hard for the class of problems solvable in polynomial time using a parallel access to an NP oracle.

In the course of this study, we also exhibit some connections between the algebraic structure of automaton (semi)groups and their dynamics on the boundary. First, we show that it is undecidable to check whether the group generated by a given invertible automaton has a positive relation, i.e., a relation p = 1 such that p only contains positive generators. Besides its obvious relation to the freeness of the group, the absence of positive relations has previously been studied by the first two authors and is connected to the triviality of some stabilizers of the boundary. We show that the emptiness of the set of positive relations is equivalent to the dynamical property that all (directed positive) orbital graphs centered at non-singular points are acyclic. Our approach also works to show undecidability of the freeness problem for automaton semigroups, which negatively solves an open problem by Grigorchuk, Nekrashevych and Sushchansky. In fact, we show undecidability of a strengthened version where the input automaton is complete and invertible. Gillibert showed that the finiteness problem for automaton semigroups is undecidable. In the second part of the paper, we show that this undecidability result also holds if the input is restricted to be bi-reversible and invertible (but, in general, not complete).

We show that if a coloring of a digraph is not synchronizing, then the stationary distribution of an associated Markov chain has a partition of coordinates into blocks of equal sum. Moreover, if there exists such a partition, then there exists a non-synchronizing automaton with such stationary distribution. We extend these results to bound the number of non-synchronizing colorings for digraphs with particular eigenvectors. We also demonstrate that the length of the shortest synchronizing word of any coloring is at most $w^2 - 3w + 3$, where $w$ is the sum of the coordinates of the integer principal eigenvector of the digraph.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Vladimir V.

The continuous-time trajectory is shown to satisfy the specification if and only if the trace does. General topological conditions on the sample points are derived that ensure a trace is recorded for arbitrary continuous paths, given arbitrary region descriptions. Using techniques from computer algebra, a trace generation algorithm is developed to satisfy these conditions when the path and region boundaries are defined by polynomials.

In this paper, we show that every regular function, either on finite words or on infinite words, captured by a deterministic two-way transducer, can be described with a regular transducer expression (RTE). For infinite words, the transducer uses Muller acceptance and \u03c9-regular look-ahead. RTEs are constructed from constant functions using the combinators if-then-else (deterministic choice), Hadamard product, and unambiguous versions of the Cauchy product, the 2-chained Kleene-iteration and the 2-chained omega-iteration. Our proof works for transformations of both finite and infinite words, extending the result on finite words of Alur et al. in LICS'14. In order to construct an RTE associated with a deterministic two-way Muller transducer with look-ahead, we introduce the notion of transition monoid for such two-way transducers where the look-ahead is captured by some backward deterministic B\u00fcchi automaton. Then, we use an unambiguous version of Imre Simon's famous forest factorization theorem in order to derive a \"good\" (\u03c9-)regular expression for the domain of the two-way transducer. \"Good\" expressions are unambiguous and Kleene-plus as well as \u03c9-iterations are only used on subexpressions corresponding to idempotent elements of the transition monoid.

To do this we define a class of context-free grammars, called B-ESG grammars, that are suitable for defining entire families of string graphs, and crucially, of string graph rewrite rules. We show that the language-membership and match-enumeration problems are decidable for these grammars, and hence that there is an algorithm for rewriting string graphs according to B-ESG rewrite patterns.

Hybrid automata can be considered as generalizations of finite state automata augmented with a finite set of real-valued variables whose dynamics in each state is governed by a system of ordinary differential equations. Moreover, the discrete transitions of hybrid automata are guarded by constraints over the values of these real-valued variables, and enable discontinuous jumps in the evolution of these variables. Singular hybrid automata are a subclass of hybrid automata where dynamics is specified by state-dependent constant vectors. Henzinger, Kopke, Puri, and Varaiya showed that for even very restricted subclasses of singular hybrid automata, the fundamental verification questions, like reachability and schedulability, are undecidable. Recently, Alur, Wojtczak, and Trivedi studied an interesting class of hybrid systems, called constant-rate multi-mode systems, where schedulability and reachability analysis can be performed in polynomial time. Inspired by the definition of constant-rate multi-mode systems, in this paper we introduce weak singular hybrid automata (WSHA), a previously unexplored subclass of singular hybrid automata, and show the decidability (and the exact complexity) of various verification questions for this class including reachability (NP-Complete) and LTL model-checking (Pspace-Complete).

In this paper, we systematically study asynchronous analyses for hyperproperties by introducing both a novel automata model (Alternating Asynchronous Parity Automata) and the temporal fixpoint calculus H\u00b5, the first fixpoint calculus that can systematically express hyperproperties in an asynchronous manner and at the same time subsumes the existing logic HyperLTL. We show that the expressive power of both models coincides over fixed path assignments. The high expressive power of both models is evidenced by the fact that decision problems of interest are highly undecidable, i.e. not even arithmetical. As a remedy, we propose approximative analyses for both models that also induce natural decidable fragments.", "venue": "Proc. ACM Program.

Due to their good compositional properties, history deterministic automata are useful in solving games and synthesis problems. Deciding whether or not a given nondeterministic automaton is history deterministic (the HDness problem) is generally a difficult task, which might involve an exponential procedure, or even be undecidable, for example for pushdown automata. Token games provide a PTime solution to the HDness problem of B\u00fcchi and coB\u00fcchi automata, and it is conjectured that 2-token games characterize HDness for all \u03c9-regular automata. We extend token games to the quantitative setting and analyze their potential to help deciding HDness for quantitative automata. In particular, we show that 1-token games characterize HDness for all quantitative (and Boolean) automata on finite words, as well as discounted-sum (DSum) automata on infinite words, and that 2-token games characterize HDness of LimInf and LimSup automata. Using these characterizations, we provide solutions to the HDness problem of Inf and Sup automata on finite words in PTime, for DSum automata on finite and infinite words in NP\u2229co-NP, for LimSup automata in quasipolynomial time, and for LimInf automata in exponential time, where the latter two are only polynomial for automata with a fixed number of weights.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Udi  Boker", "Karoliina  Lehtinen"], "year": 2021, "n_citations": 0}

We apply this embedding to generalize Soloveichik and Winfree's local determinism criterion (for achieving a unique terminal assembly), from assembly systems of 4-sided tiles that embed in the plane, to arbitrary graph assembly systems. We present a partial converse of the embedding result, by providing sufficient conditions under which systems of distributed processors can be simulated by graph assembly systems topologically, in the plane, and in 3-space. We conclude by defining a new complexity measure: \"surface cost\" (essentially the convex hull of the space inhabited by agents at the conclusion of a self-assembled computation). We show that, for growth-bounded graphs, executing a subroutine to find a Maximum Independent Set only increases the surface cost of a self-assembling computation by a constant factor.

Our definition of pPDA allows both probabilistic and non-deterministic branching, generalising the classical notion of pushdown automata (without epsilon-transitions). Our first contribution is a general construction that reduces checking bisimilarity of probabilistic transition systems to checking bisimilarity of non-deterministic transition systems. This construction directly yields decidability of bisimilarity for pPDA, as well as an elementary upper bound for the bisimilarity problem on the subclass of probabilistic basic process algebras, i.e., single-state pPDA. We further show that, with careful analysis, the general reduction can be used to prove an EXPTIME upper bound for bisimilarity of probabilistic visibly pushdown automata. Here we also provide a matching lower bound, establishing EXPTIME-completeness. Finally we prove that deciding bisimilarity of probabilistic one-counter automata, another subclass of pPDA, is PSPACE-complete.

Moreover, studying the dynamics of how rules emerge under artificial selection for function has recently become a powerful tool for understanding how evolution can innovate within its genetic rule space. However, conventional cellular automata lack the kind of state feedback that is surely present in natural evolving systems. Each new generation of a population leaves an indelible mark on its environment and thus affects the selective pressures that shape future generations of that population. To model this phenomenon, we have augmented traditional cellular automata with state-dependent feedback. Rather than generating automata executions from an initial condition and a static rule, we introduce mappings which generate iteration rules from the cellular automaton itself. We show that these new automata contain disconnected regions which locally act like conventional automata, thus encapsulating multiple functions into one structure. Consequently, we have provided a new model for processes like cell differentiation. Finally, by studying the size of these regions, we provide additional evidence that the dynamics of self-reference may be critical to understanding the evolution of natural language.

This motivates the introduction of a constructive variant of one-tape machines, called weight-reducing machine, and the investigation of its properties. We focus on the deterministic case. In particular, we show that, paying a polynomial size increase only, each weight-reducing machine can be turned into a halting one that works in linear time.

Recently, RPQs have been extended by Libkin and Vrgo$\\rm \\check{c}$ to incorporate data value comparisons among different nodes on paths, called regular path queries with data (RDPQ). It has been shown that the evaluation problem of RDPQs is PSPACE-complete and NLOGSPACE-complete in data complexity. On the other hand, the containment problem of RDPQs is in general undecidable. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to extend regular path queries with data value comparisons, called rigid regular path queries with data (RRDPQ). The main ingredient of this approach is an automata model called nondeterministic rigid register automata (NRRA), in which the data value comparisons are \\emph{rigid}, in the sense that if the data value in the current position $x$ is compared to a data value in some other position $y$, then by only using the labels (but not data values), the position $y$ can be uniquely determined from $x$. We show that NRRAs are robust in the sense that nondeterministic, deterministic and two-way variant of NRRAs, as well as an extension of regular expressions, are all of the same expressivity. We then argue that the expressive power of RDPQs are reasonable by demonstrating that for every graph database, there is a localized transformation of the graph database so that every RDPQ in the original graph database can be turned into an equivalent RRDPQ over the transformed one.

Like hyper-minimisation, relaxed minimisation allows for some changes in the language of the automaton: We seek a smallest automaton that, when used as a monitor, provides a wrong answer only a bounded number of times in any run of a system. We argue that minimisation of finite automata, hyper-minimisation, relaxed minimisation, and the minimisation of deterministic Buchi (or Co-Buchi) automata are operations of increasing reduction power, as the respective equivalence relations on automata become coarser from left to right. When we allow for minor changes in the language, relaxed minimisation can therefore be considered as a more powerful minimisation technique than hyper-minimisation from the perspective of finite automata. From the perspective of Buchi and Co-Buchi automata, we gain a cheap algorithm for state-space reduction that also turns out to be beneficial for further heuristic or exhaustive state-space reductions put on top of it.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Sven  Schewe"], "year": 2010, "n_citations": 6}

At the center of these modeling languages we find finite state machines that allow for a fine-grained description how and when specific service requests may interact with other components or the environment. Unfortunately, automata-based approaches suffer from exponential state explosion, a major obstacle to the successful application of these formalisms in modeling real-world scenarios. In order to cope with the complexity of individual specifications we can apply partition refinement, an abstraction technique to alleviate the state explosion problem. But this technique too exhibits exponential time and space complexity and, worse, does not offer any guarantees for success. To better understand as to why partition refinement succeeds in some cases while it fails in others, we conducted an empirical study on the performance of a partition refinement algorithm for Component Interaction Automata specifications. As a result we have identified suitable predictors for the expected effectiveness of partition refinement. It is the structure, not the size, of a specification that weighs heavier on the outcome of partition refinement. In particular, Component Interaction Automata specifications for real-world systems are capable of producing scale-free networks containing structural artifacts that can assist the partition refinement algorithm not only converge earlier, but also yield a significant state space reduction on occasion.", "venue": "WCSI", "authors": ["Markus  Lumpe", "Rajesh  Vasa"], "year": 2010, "n_citations": 2}

VASS provide a fundamental model for analysis of concurrent processes, parametrized systems, and they are also used as abstract models for programs for bounds analysis. While termination is the basic liveness property that asks the qualitative question of whether a given model always terminates or not, the more general quantitative question asks for bounds on the number of steps to termination. In the realm of quantitative bounds a fundamental problem is to obtain asymptotic bounds on termination time. Large asymptotic bounds such as exponential or higher already suggest that either there is some error in modeling, or the model is not useful in practice. Hence we focus on polynomial asymptotic bounds for VASS. While some well-known approaches (e.g., lexicographic ranking functions) are neither sound nor complete with respect to polynomial bounds, other approaches only present sound methods for upper bounds. In this work our main contributions are as follows: First, for linear asymptotic bounds we present a sound and complete method for VASS, and moreover, our algorithm runs in polynomial time. Second, we classify VASS according the normals of the vectors of the cycles. We show that singularities in the normal are the key reason for asymptotic bounds such as exponential and non-elementary for VASS. In absence of singularities, we show that the asymptotic complexity bound is always polynomial and of the form ${\\Theta}(n^k)$, for some k $\\leq$ d.

Current clinical practice is to insert needles under image guidance or haptic feedback, although that may involve reinsertions and adjustments since the needle and its interaction with the tissue during insertion cannot be completely controlled. (Automated) needle steering could in theory improve the accuracy with which a target is reached and thus reduce surgical traumata especially for minimally invasive procedures, e.g., brachytherapy or biopsy. Yet, flexible needles and needle-tissue interaction are both complex and expensive to model and can often be computed approximatively only. In this paper we propose to employ timed games to navigate flexible needles with a bevel tip to reach a fixed target in tissue. We use a simple non-holonomic model of needle-tissue interaction, which abstracts in particular from the various physical forces involved and appears to be simplistic compared to related models from medical robotics. Based on the model, we synthesize strategies from which we can derive sufficiently precise motion plans to steer the needle in soft tissue. However, applying those strategies in practice, one is faced with the problem of an unpredictable behavior of the needle at the initial insertion point. Our proposal is to implement a preprocessing step to initialize the model based on data from the real system, once the needle is inserted. Taking into account the actual needle tip angle and position, we generate strategies to reach the desired target. We have implemented the model in Uppaal Stratego and evaluated it on steering a flexible needle in gelatin phantoms; gelatin phantoms are commonly used in medical technology to simulate the behavior of soft tissue. The experiments show that strategies can be synthesized for both generated and measured needle motions with a maximum deviation of 1.84mm.", "venue": "MARS@ETAPS", "authors": ["Antje  Rogalla", "Sascha  Lehmann", "Maximilian  Neidhardt", "Johanna  Sprenger", "Marcel  Bengs", "Alexander  Schlaefer", "Sibylle  Schupp"], "year": 2020, "n_citations": 1}

Often, a specification contains both Boolean requirements that should be satisfied against an adversarial environment, and multi-valued components that refer to the quality of the satisfaction and whose expected cost we would like to minimize with respect to a probabilistic environment. \nIn this work we study, for the first time, mean-payoff games in which the system aims at minimizing the expected cost against a probabilistic environment, while surely satisfying an $\\omega$-regular condition against an adversarial environment. We consider the case the $\\omega$-regular condition is given as a parity objective or by an LTL formula. We show that in general, optimal strategies need not exist, and moreover, the limit value cannot be approximated by finite-memory strategies. We thus focus on computing the limit-value, and give tight complexity bounds for synthesizing $\\epsilon$-optimal strategies for both finite-memory and infinite-memory strategies. \nWe show that our game naturally arises in various contexts of synthesis with Boolean and multi-valued objectives.

However properties that are not stutter-insensitive, for instance due to the use of the neXt operator of LTL or to some form of counting in the logic, are not covered by these techniques in general. We propose in this paper to study a weaker property than stutter-insensitivity. In a stutter insensitive language both adding and removing stutter to a word does not change its acceptance, any stuttering can be abstracted away; by decomposing this equivalence relation into two implications we obtain weaker conditions. We define a shortening insensitive language where any word that stutters less than a word in the language must also belong to the language. A lengthening insensitive language has the dual property. A semi-decision procedure is then introduced to reliably prove shortening insensitive properties or deny lengthening insensitive properties while working with a reduction of a system. A reduction has the property that it can only shorten runs. Lipton\u2019s transaction reductions or Petri net agglomerations are examples of eligible structural reduction strategies. An implementation and experimental evidence is provided showing most nonrandom properties sensitive to stutter are actually shortening or lengthening insensitive. Performance of experiments on a large (random) benchmark from the model-checking competition indicate that despite being a semi-decision procedure, the approach can still improve state of the art verification tools.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Emmanuel  Paviot-Adet", "Denis  Poitrenaud", "Etienne  Renault", "Yann  Thierry-Mieg"], "year": 2021, "n_citations": 0}

We consider the following decision problem: let S be a set of nonnegative integers that is b-recognisable, given as a finite automaton over { 0, 1, ..., b-1 }, is S periodic? Honkala showed in 1986 that this problem is decidable. Later on, Leroux used in 2005 the convention to write number representations with the least significant digit first (LSDF), and designed a quadratic algorithm to solve a more general problem. We use here LSDF convention as well and give a structural description of the minimal automata that accept periodic sets.

To this end, we formally define aggregate functions over regular document spanners and analyze the computational complexity of exact and approximative computation of the aggregates. To be precise, we show that in a restricted case all aggregates can be computed in polynomial time. In general, however, even though exact computation is intractable, some aggregates can still be approximated with fully polynomial-time randomized approximation schemes (FPRAS).", "venue": "ICDT", "authors": ["Johannes  Doleschal", "Noa  Bratman", "Benny  Kimelfeld", "Wim  Martens"], "year": 2021, "n_citations": 2}

Unfortunately, string analyses for dynamic languages still lack precision and do not take into account some important string features. Moreover, string obfuscation is very popular in the context of dynamic language malicious code, for example, to hide code information inside strings and then to dynamically transform strings into executable code.

Hyperproperties have been shown to be a powerful formalism for expressing and reasoning about information-flow security policies and important properties of cyber-physical systems such as sensitivity and robustness, as well as consistency conditions in distributed computing such as linearizability. Although there is an extensive body of work on automata-based representation of trace properties, we currently lack such characterization for hyperproperties. We introduce hyperautomata for em hyperlanguages, which are languages over sets of words. Essentially, hyperautomata allow running multiple quantified words over an automaton. We propose a specific type of hyperautomata called nondeterministic finite hyperautomata (NFH), which accept regular hyperlanguages. We demonstrate the ability of regular hyperlanguages to express hyperproperties for finite traces. We then explore the fundamental properties of NFH and show their closure under the Boolean operations. We show that while nonemptiness is undecidable in general, it is decidable for several fragments of NFH. We further show the decidability of the membership problem for finite sets and regular languages for NFH, as well as the containment problem for several fragments of NFH.

Previous works have considered NWA that processed input words only in the forward direction. It is natural to allow the automata to process input words backwards as well, for example, to measure the maximal or average time between a response and the preceding request. We therefore introduce and study bidirectional NWA that can process input words in both directions. First, we show that bidirectional NWA can express interesting quantitative properties that are not expressible by forward-only NWA. Second, for the fundamental decision problems of emptiness and universality, we establish decidability and complexity results for the new framework which match the best-known results for the special case of forward-only NWA. Thus, for NWA, the increased expressiveness of bidirectionality is achieved at no additional computational complexity. This is in stark contrast to the unweighted case, where bidirectional finite automata are no more expressive but exponentially more succinct than their forward-only counterparts.", "venue": "CONCUR", "authors": ["Krishnendu  Chatterjee", "Thomas A.

While weighted automata over finite and infinite words provide a natural and flexible framework to express quantitative properties, perhaps surprisingly, some basic system properties such as average response time cannot be expressed using weighted automata, nor in any other know decidable formalism. In this work, we introduce nested weighted automata as a natural extension of weighted automata which makes it possible to express important quantitative properties such as average response time. In nested weighted automata, a master automaton spins off and collects results from weighted slave automata, each of which computes a quantity along a finite portion of an infinite word. Nested weighted automata can be viewed as the quantitative analogue of monitor automata, which are used in run-time verification. We establish an almost complete decidability picture for the basic decision problems about nested weighted automata, and illustrate their applicability in several domains.

Active deception in a network employs decoy systems and other defenses to conduct defensive planning against the intrusion of malicious attackers who have been confirmed by sensing systems. In this setting, the defender's objective is to ensure the satisfaction of security properties specified in temporal logic formulas. We formulate the problem of deceptive planning with decoy systems and other defenses as a two-player games with asymmetrical information and Boolean payoffs in temporal logic. We use level-2 hypergame with temporal logic objectives to capture the incomplete/incorrect knowledge of the attacker about the network system as a payoff misperception. The true payoff function is private information of the defender. Then, we extend the solution concepts of $omega$-regular games to analyze the attacker's rational strategy given her incomplete information. By generalizing the solution of level-2 hypergame in the normal form to extensive form, we extend the solutions of games with safe temporal logic objectives to decide whether the defender can ensure security properties to be satisfied with probability one, given any possible strategy that is perceived to be rational by the attacker. Further, we use the solution of games with co-safe (reachability) temporal logic objectives to determine whether the defender can engage the attacker, by directing the attacker to a high-fidelity honeypot.

In this study, the specification of cellular automata with complex behaviors was obtained by utilizing randomly generated specimens.

Comput. Biol. 17/12, 2010) compute waiting times for k-mers to appear during DNA evolution under the assumption that the considered k-mers do not occur in the initial DNA sequence, an issue arising when studying the evolution of regulatory DNA sequences with regard to transcription factor (TF) binding site emergence. The mathematical analysis underlying their computation assumes that occurrences of words under interest do not overlap. We relax here this assumption by use of an automata approach. In an alphabet of size 4 like the DNA alphabet, most words have no or a low autocorrelation; therefore, globally, our results confirm those of Behrens and Vingron. The outcome is quite different when considering highly autocorrelated k-mers; in this case, the autocorrelation pushes down the probability of occurrence of these k-mers at generation 1 and, consequently, increases the waiting time for apparition of these k-mers up to 40%. An analysis of existing TF binding sites unveils a significant proportion of k-mers exhibiting autocorrelation. Thus, our computations based on automata greatly improve the accuracy of predicting waiting times for the emergence of TF binding sites to appear during DNA evolution. We do the computation in the Bernoulli or M0 model; computations in the M1 model, a Markov model of order 1, are more costly in terms of time and memory but should produce similar results. While Behrens and Vingron considered specifically promoters of length 1000, we extend the results to promoters of any size; we exhibit the property that the probability that a k-mer occurs at generation time 1 while being absent at time 0 behaves linearly with respect to the length of the promoter, which induces a hyperbolic behaviour of the waiting time of any k-mer with respect to the length of the promoter.

Linear temporal logic (LTL) provides a formal language to specify the desired behavioral properties of systems. In applications in which the specifications originate from various aspects of the system design, or consist of a large set of formulas, the overall system specification may be unrealizable. Driven by this fact, we develop an optimization variant of synthesis from LTL formulas, where the goal is to design a controller that satisfies a set of hard specifications and minimally violates a set of soft specifications. To that end, we introduce a value function that, by exploiting the LTL semantics, quantifies the level of violation of properties. Inspired by the idea of bounded synthesis, we fix a bound on the implementation size and search for an implementation that is optimal with respect to the said value function. We propose a novel maximum satisfiability encoding of the search for an optimal implementation (within the given bound on the implementation size).

We show that these programs also have a decidable complexity property: one can determine whether the length of all transition sequences can be bounded in terms of the initial state. This is the Bounded Termination problem. Interestingly, if a bound exists, it must be polynomial. We prove that the bounded termination problem is PSPACE-complete. \nWe also discuss, theoretically, the use of bounds on the abstract program to infer conclusions on a concrete program that has been abstracted.

Despite of its popularity, model checking suffers from the state space explosion problem that restricts it from being applied to certain systems, or specifications. Many works have been proposed in the past to address the state space explosion problem, and they have achieved some success, but the inherent complexity still remains an obstacle for purely symbolic approaches. In this paper, we propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN) based approach for model checking, where the model is expressed using a B\u00fcchi automaton and the property to be verified is expressed using Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). We express the model as a GNN, and propose a novel node embedding framework that encodes the LTL property and characteristics of the model. We reduce the LTL model checking problem to a graph classification problem, where there are two classes, 1 (if the model satisfies the specification) and 0 (if the model does not satisfy the specification).

Failures in safety-critical contexts such as humanrobot interactions or even autonomous driving can ultimately lead to loss of life. In this context, this paper aims to provide a method by which one can algorithmically test and evaluate an autonomous system. Given a black-box autonomous system with some operational specifications, we construct a minimax problem based on control barrier functions to generate a family of test parameters designed to optimally evaluate whether the system can satisfy the specifications. To illustrate our results, we utilize the Robotarium as a case study for an autonomous system that claims to satisfy waypoint navigation and obstacle avoidance simultaneously.

Furthermore, the existential and universal threshold problems, the language inclusion problem and the equivalence problem are all decidable when the weighted automata are functional. On the negative side, we also study the quantitative extension of the realizability problem and show that it is undecidable for sum, mean and ratio.

The results on functionality and determinizability are expressed for the more general class of functional weighted automata over groups.

They have been studied for both classical and also quantum communication and for various models and modes of communication. Buhrman et al. [Buh98] proved that the exact quantum communication complexity for a promise version of the equality problem is ${\\bf O}(\\log {n})$ while the classical deterministic communication complexity is $n+1$ for two-way communication, which was the first impressively large (exponential) gap between quantum and classical (deterministic and probabilistic) communication complexity. If an error is tolerated, both quantum and probabilistic communication complexities for equality are ${\\bf O}(\\log {n})$. However, even if an error is tolerated, the gaps between quantum (probabilistic) and deterministic complexity are not larger than quadratic for the disjointness problem. It is therefore interesting to ask whether there are some promise versions of the disjointness problem for which bigger gaps can be shown. We give a positive answer to such a question. Namely, we prove that there exists an exponential gap between quantum (even probabilistic) communication complexity and classical deterministic communication complexity of some specific versions of the disjointness problem. \nKlauck [Kla00] proved, for any language, that the state complexity of exact quantum/classical finite automata, which is a general model of one-way quantum finite automata, is not less than the state complexity of an equivalent one-way deterministic finite automata (1DFA).

In a delay game, one of the players may delay her moves to obtain a lookahead on her opponent's moves. We show that determining the winner of delay games with winning conditions given by parity automata with costs is EXPTIME-complete and that exponential bounded lookahead is both sufficient and in general necessary. Thus, although the parity condition with costs is a quantitative extension of the parity condition, our results show that adding costs does not increase the complexity of delay games with parity conditions. Furthermore, we study a new phenomenon that appears in quantitative delay games: lookahead can be traded for the quality of winning strategies and vice versa. We determine the extent of this tradeoff. In particular, even the smallest lookahead allows to improve the quality of an optimal strategy from the worst possible value to almost the smallest possible one. Thus, the benefit of introducing lookahead is twofold: not only does it allow the delaying player to win games she would lose without, but lookahead also allows her to improve the quality of her winning strategies in games she wins even without lookahead.", "venue": "2017 32nd Annual ACM/IEEE Symposium on Logic in Computer Science (LICS)", "authors": ["Martin  Zimmermann"], "year": 2017, "n_citations": 4}

As main technical result it is proved that any such composition can be realized as a linear-bounded composition, which means that the sizes of the intermediate results can be chosen to be at most linear in the size of the output tree. This has consequences for the expressiveness and complexity of the translations in the hierarchy. First, if the computed translation is a function of linear size increase, i.e., the size of the output tree is at most linear in the size of the input tree, then it can be realized by just one, deterministic, tree-walking tree transducer. For compositions of deterministic transducers it is decidable whether or not the translation is of linear size increase. Second, every composition of deterministic transducers can be computed in deterministic linear time on a RAM and in deterministic linear space on a Turing machine, measured in the sum of the sizes of the input and output tree. Similarly, every composition of nondeterministic transducers can be computed in simultaneous polynomial time and linear space on a nondeterministic Turing machine. Their output tree languages are deterministic context-sensitive, i.e., can be recognized in deterministic linear space on a Turing machine. The membership problem for compositions of nondeterministic translations is nondeterministic polynomial time and deterministic linear space. All the above results also hold for compositions of macro tree transducers. The membership problem for the composition of a nondeterministic and a deterministic tree-walking tree translation (for a nondeterministic IO macro tree translation) is log-space reducible to a context-free language, whereas the membership problem for the composition of a deterministic and a nondeterministic tree-walking tree translation (for a nondeterministic OI macro tree translation) is possibly NP-complete.", "venue": "Acta Informatica", "authors": ["Joost  Engelfriet", "Kazuhiro  Inaba", "Sebastian  Maneth"], "year": 2019, "n_citations": 1}

The register is initialized to the identity element of the group and a computation is successful if the register is equal to the identity element at the end of the computation after being multiplied with a group element at every step.

When the monoid is commutative, we prove that every regular function can be constructed from constant functions using the combinators of choice, split sum, and iterated sum, that are analogs of union, concatenation, and Kleene-*, respectively, but enforce unique (or unambiguous) parsing. Our main result is for the general case of non-commutative monoids, which is of particular interest for capturing regular string-to-string transformations for document processing. We prove that the following additional combinators suffice for constructing all regular functions: (1) the left-additive versions of split sum and iterated sum, which allow transformations such as string reversal; (2) sum of functions, which allows transformations such as copying of strings; and (3) function composition, or alternatively, a new concept of chained sum, which allows output values from adjacent blocks to mix.", "venue": "CSL-LICS", "authors": ["Rajeev  Alur", "Adam  Freilich", "Mukund  Raghothaman"], "year": 2014, "n_citations": 45}

We define six types of bisimulations, but due to the duality we discuss three of them: forward, backward-forward, and weak forward bisimulations. For each of these three types of bisimulations we provide a procedure which decides whether there is a bisimulation of this type between two automata, and when it exists, the same procedure computes the greatest one.

Furthermore, we cover a wide class of attacks that can nondeterministically add, remove, or rewrite a sensing and/or actuation word to any word from predefined regular languages, and show how such attacks can be modeled by nondeterministic FSTs; we also present how the use of FSTs facilitates modeling realistic (and very complex) attacks, as well as provides the foundation for design of attack-resilient supervisory controllers.

Four families of totalistic rules are considered: linear or matrix defined rules (a node takes state 1 if each of its neighbours is in state 1), threshold rules (a node takes state 1 if the sum of its neighbours exceed a threshold), isolated rules (a node takes state 1 if the sum of its neighbours equals to some single number) and interval rule (a node takes state 1 if the sum of its neighbours belong to some discrete interval).

Therefore, there have been several proposals to underapproximate their sets of runs so that reachability in this underapproximation becomes decidable. One such underapproximation that covers a relatively high portion of runs is scope boundedness. In such a run, after each push to stack i, the corresponding pop operation must come within a bounded number of visits to stack i. In this work, we generalize this approach to a large class of infinite-state systems. For this, we consider the model of valence systems, which consist of a finite-state control and an infinitestate storage mechanism that is specified by a finite undirected graph. This framework captures pushdowns, vector addition systems, integer vector addition systems, and combinations thereof. For this framework, we propose a notion of scope boundedness that coincides with the classical notion when the storage mechanism happens to be a multi-pushdown. We show that with this notion, reachability can be decided in PSPACE for every storage mechanism in the framework. Moreover, we describe the full complexity landscape of this problem across all storage mechanisms, both in the case of (i) the scope bound being given as input and (ii) for fixed scope bounds.

In the realizability optimization problem, one is interested in computing the minimal such bound that allows to realize a given specification. It is known that this problem is solvable in triply-exponential time, but not whether it can be done in doubly-exponential time, i.e., whether it is just as hard as solving LTL realizability. \nWe take a step towards resolving this problem by showing that the optimum can be approximated within a factor of two in doubly-exponential time. Also, we report on a proof-of-concept implementation of the algorithm based on bounded LTL synthesis, which computes the smallest implementation of a given specification. In our experiments, we observe a tradeoff between the size of the implementation and the bound it realizes.

In this paper, we show that if we use architecturally restricted verifiers instead of restricting the working memory, i.e. replacing the working tape(s) with a single counter, we can define some IPS's for each decidable language. Such verifiers are called two-way probabilistic one-counter automata (2pca's). Then, we show that by adding a fixed-size quantum memory to a 2pca, called a two-way one-counter automaton with quantum and classical states (2qcca), the protocol can be space efficient. As a further result, if the 2qcca can use a quantum counter instead of a classical one, then the protocol can even be public, also known as Arthur-Merlin games. \nWe also investigate the computational power of 2pca's and 2qcca's as language recognizers. We show that bounded-error 2pca's can be more powerful than their deterministic counterparts by giving a bounded-error simulation of their nondeterministic counterparts. Then, we present a new programming technique for bounded-error 2qcca's and show that they can recognize a language which seems not to be recognized by any bounded-error 2pca.

We show that there might exist a deceptive winning strategy for P1 that ensures P1's objective is achieved with probability one from a state otherwise losing for P1, had the information being symmetric and complete.

Rare event simulation (RES) provides techniques to reduce the number of samples in the case of rare events.

This lack of homogeneity makes the integration and security management of IoT infrastructures a daunting task for users and administrators. In this paper, we introduce VISCR, a Vendor-Independent policy Specification and Conflict Resolution engine that enables conflict-free policy specification and enforcement in IoT environments. VISCR converts the topology of the IoT infrastructure into a tree-based abstraction and translates existing policies from heterogeneous vendor-specific programming languages such as Groovy-based SmartThings, OpenHAB, IFTTT-based templates, and MUD-based profiles into a vendor-independent graph-based specification. Using the two, VISCR can automatically detect rouge policies, conflicts, and bugs for coherent automation. Upon detection, VISCR infers new policies and proposes them to users as alternatives to existing policies for fine-tuning and conflict-free enforcement. We evaluated VISCR using a dataset of 907 IoT apps, programmed using heterogeneous automation specifications in a simulated smart-building IoT infrastructure. In our experiments, among 907 IoT apps, VISCR exposed 342 of IoT apps as exhibiting one or more violations. VISCR detected 100% of violations reported by existing state-of-the-art tool, while detecting new types of violations in an additional 266 apps. In terms of performance, VISCR can generate 400 abstraction trees (used in specifying policies) with 100K leaf nodes in <1.2sec.

A natural modification of this distance is introduced, to obtain a discounted distance, which weakens the influence of long term transitions. We compare our notions of distance to others previously defined and illustrate our approach on various examples.

Microstates are short duration quasi-stable states of the dynamically changing electrical field topographies recorded via an array of electrodes from the human scalp, and cluster into four canonical classes. The sequence of microstates observed under particular conditions can be considered an information source with unknown underlying structure. e-machines are discrete dynamical system automata with state-dependent probabilities on different future observations (in this case the next measured EEG microstate). They artificially reproduce underlying structure in an optimally predictive manner as generative models exhibiting dynamics emulating the behaviour of the source. Here we present experiments using both simulations and empirical data supporting the value of associating these discrete dynamical systems with mental states (e.g. mind-wandering, focused attention, etc.) and with clinical populations. The neurodynamics of mental states and clinical populations can then be further characterized by properties of these dynamical systems, including: i) statistical complexity (determined by the number of states of the corresponding e-automaton); ii) entropy rate; iii) characteristic sequence patterning (syntax, probabilistic grammars); iv) duration, persistence and stability of dynamical patterns; and v) algebraic measures such as Krohn-Rhodes complexity or holonomy length of the decompositions of these.

Moreover, the output sequence O' must deviate from O \"as little as possible\" to maintain the quality.

The specification consists of a correctness requirement REQ as well as a hard deviation constraint HDC which must both be mandatorily and invariantly satisfied by the shield. Moreover, we also use quantitative optimization to give a shield which minimizes the expected value of cumulative deviation in an H-optimal fashion. We show how tool DCSynth implementing soft requirement guided synthesis can be used for automatic synthesis of shields from a given specification.

Bauer et al. introduced an influential framework for monitoring Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) properties based on a three-valued semantics: the formula is already satisfied by the given prefix, it is already violated, or it is still undetermined, i.e., it can still be satisfied and violated by appropriate extensions. However, a wide range of formulas are not monitorable under this approach, meaning that they have a prefix for which satisfaction and violation will always remain undetermined no matter how it is extended. In particular, Bauer et al. report that 44% of the formulas they consider in their experiments fall into this category. Recently, a robust semantics for LTL was introduced to capture different degrees by wich a property can be violated. In this paper we introduce a robust semantics for finite strings and show its potential in monitoring: every formula considered by Bauer et al. is monitorable under our approach. Furthermore, we discuss which properties that come naturally in LTL monitoring --- such as the realizability of all truth values --- can be transferred to the robust setting.

In this work we consider solving recursive game graphs (or pushdown game graphs) that can model the control flow of sequential programs with recursion. While pushdown games have been studied before with qualitative objectives, such as reachability and parity objectives, in this work we study for the first time such games with the most well-studied quantitative objective, namely, mean payoff objectives. In pushdown games two types of strategies are relevant: (1) global strategies, that depend on the entire global history; and (2) modular strategies, that have only local memory and thus do not depend on the context of invocation, but only on the history of the current invocation of the module. Our main results are as follows: (1) One-player pushdown games with mean-payoff objectives under global strategies are decidable in polynomial time. (2) Two-player pushdown games with mean-payoff objectives under global strategies are undecidable. (3) One-player pushdown games with mean-payoff objectives under modular strategies are NP-hard. (4) Two-player pushdown games with mean-payoff objectives under modular strategies can be solved in NP (i.e., both one-player and two-player pushdown games with mean-payoff objectives under modular strategies are NP-complete). We also establish the optimal strategy complexity showing that global strategies for mean-payoff objectives require infinite memory even in one-player pushdown games; and memoryless modular strategies are sufficient in two-player pushdown games.

As a consequence, techniques of formal verification have been recognized as crucial to the design and deployment of safe NNs. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to formally verify the most commonly considered safety specification for ReLU NNs -- i.e. polytopic specifications on the input and output of the network. Like some other approaches, ours uses a relaxed convex program to mitigate the combinatorial complexity of the problem. However, unique in our approach is the way we exploit the geometry of neuronal activation regions to further prune the search space of relaxed neuron activations. In particular, conditioning on neurons from input layer to output layer, we can regard each relaxed neuron as having the simplest possible geometry for its activation region: a half-space.This paradigm can be leveraged to create a verification algorithm that is not only faster in general than competing approaches, but is also able to verify considerably more safety properties. For example, our approach completes the standard MNIST verification test bench 2.7-50 times faster than competing algorithms while still proving 14-30% more properties.

For example, the performance of a web server may be monitored based on the ratio of the total count of requests from the least and most active clients. Exact frequency monitoring, however, can be prohibitively expensive; in the above example it would require as many counters as there are clients. In this paper, we propose the efficient probabilistic monitoring of common frequency properties, including the mode (i.e., the most common event) and the median of an event sequence. We define a logic to express composite frequency properties as a combination of atomic frequency properties. Our main contribution is an algorithm that, under suitable probabilistic assumptions, can be used to monitor these important frequency properties with four counters, independent of the number of different events. Our algorithm samples longer and longer subwords of an infinite event sequence. We prove the almost-sure convergence of our algorithm by generalizing ergodic theory from increasing-length prefixes to increasing-length subwords of an infinite sequence.

However, unlike term rewriting, which is the standard way of reasoning about the morphisms of monoidal categories, rewriting string diagrams results in shorter equational proofs, because the string diagrammatic representation allows us to formally establish equalities modulo any rewrite steps which follow from the monoidal structure. Manipulating string diagrams by hand is a time-consuming and error-prone process, especially for large string diagrams. This can be ameliorated by using software proof assistants, such as Quantomatic. However, reasoning about concrete string diagrams may be limiting and in some scenarios it is necessary to reason about entire (infinite) families of string diagrams. When doing so, we face the same problems as for manipulating concrete string diagrams, but in addition, we risk making further mistakes if we are not precise enough about the way we represent (infinite) families of string diagrams. The primary goal of this thesis is to design a mathematical framework for equational reasoning about infinite families of string diagrams which is amenable to computer automation. We will be working with context-free families of string diagrams and we will represent them using context-free graph grammars. We will model equations between infinite families of diagrams using rewrite rules between context-free grammars. Our framework represents equational reasoning about concrete string diagrams and context-free families of string diagrams using double-pushout rewriting on graphs and context-free graph grammars respectively. We will prove that our representation is sound by showing that it respects the concrete semantics of string diagrammatic reasoning and we will show that our framework is appropriate for software implementation by proving important decidability properties.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Vladimir Nikolaev Zamdzhiev"], "year": 2016, "n_citations": 3}

A formal contract distinguishes between assumptions, which are constraints that the designer of a component puts on the environments in which the component can be used safely, and guarantees, which are promises that the designer asks from the team that implements the component. A theory of formal contracts can be formalized as an interface theory, which supports the composition and refinement of both assumptions and guarantees. Although there is a rich landscape of contract-based design methods that address functional and extra-functional properties, we present the first interface theory that is designed for ensuring system-wide security properties, thus paving the way for a science of safety and security co-engineering. Our framework provides a refinement relation and a composition operation that support both incremental design and independent implementability. We develop our theory for both stateless and stateful interfaces. We illustrate the applicability of our framework with an example inspired from the automotive domain. Finally, we provide three plausible trace semantics to stateful information-flow interfaces and we show that only two correspond to temporal logics for specifying hyperproperties, while the third defines a new class of hyperproperties that lies between the other two classes.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Ezio  Bartocci", "Thomas  Ferrere", "Thomas A.

Indeed, one may want to access the part of the memory that is below the current stack or base pointer, hence the need for a model that keeps track of this part of the memory. To this end, we introduce pushdown systems with an upper stack (UPDSs), an extension of PDSs where symbols popped from the stack are not destroyed but instead remain just above its top, and may be overwritten by later push rules. We prove that the sets of successors \\(post^*\\) and predecessors \\(pre^*\\) of a regular set of configurations of such a system are not always regular, but that \\(post^*\\) is context-sensitive, so that we can decide whether a single configuration is forward reachable or not. In order to underapproximate \\(pre^*\\) in a regular fashion, we consider a bounded-phase analysis of UPDSs, where a phase is a part of a run during which either push or pop rules are forbidden. We then present a method to overapproximate \\(post^*\\) that relies on regular abstractions of runs of UPDSs.

We present Deterministic temporal logics, with diverse sets of modalities, which also characterize UL. The tools and techniques used go under the name of \"Turtle Programs\" or \"Rankers\". These are simple kinds of automata. We use properties such as Ranker Directionality and Ranker Convexity to show that all these logics have NP satisfiability. A recursive extension of some of these modalities gives us the full power of first-order logic over finite linear orders.

A well-studied class of objectives is the one of \u03c9-regular objectives, due to its relation to many natural problems in theoretical computer science. We focus on the strategy complexity question: given an objective, how much memory does each player require to play as well as possible? A classical result is that finite-memory strategies suffice for both players when the objective is \u03c9-regular. We show a reciprocal of that statement: when both players can play optimally with a chromatic finite-memory structure (i.e., whose updates can only observe colors) in all infinite game graphs, then the objective must be \u03c9-regular. This provides a game-theoretic characterization of \u03c9-regular objectives, and this characterization can help in obtaining memory bounds. Moreover, a by-product of our characterization is a new one-to-two-player lift: to show that chromatic finite-memory structures suffice to play optimally in two-player games on infinite graphs, it suffices to show it in the simpler case of one-player games on infinite graphs.

In order to reason about LTL f , formulas are typically compiled into deterministic finite automata (DFA), as the intermediate semantic representation. Moreover, due to the fact that DFAs have canonical representation, efficient minimization algorithms can be applied to maximally reduce DFA size, helping to speed up subsequent computations. Here, we present a thorough investigation on two classical minimization algorithms, namely, the Hopcroft and Brzozowski algorithms.

We then compare the two algorithms in the context of an LTL f -synthesis framework, starting from LTL f formulas. While earlier studies on comparing the two algorithms starting from randomly-generated automata concluded that neither algorithm dominates, our results suggest that starting from LTL f formulas, Hopcroft\u2019s algorithm is the best choice in the context of reactive synthesis.

Such complexity properties are undecidable for a Turing-complete programming language, and a common work-around in program analysis is to settle for sound but incomplete solutions. In contrast, we consider a class of programs that is Turing-incomplete, but strong enough to include several challenges for this kind of analysis. For a related language that has well-structured syntax, similar to Meyer and Ritchie's LOOP programs, the problem has been previously proved to be decidable. The analysis relied on the compositionality of programs, hence the challenge in obtaining similar results for flowchart programs with arbitrary control-flow graphs. Our answer to the challenge is twofold: first, we propose a class of loop-annotated flowcharts, which is more general than the class of flowcharts that directly represent structured programs; secondly, we present a technique to reuse the ideas from the work on tructured programs and apply them to such flowcharts.

We define a class of \u201cuniform\u201d unary operations for which this approach works; the class is closed under composition and includes common operations such as star, reversal, and complement.

A particular case of this result is that the profinite completion of any abstract algebra is the extended Stone dual space of the Boolean algebra of recognizable subsets of the abstract algebra endowed with certain residuation operations. These results identify a connection between topological algebra as applied in algebra and Stone duality as applied in logic, and show that the notion of recognition originating in computer science is intrinsic to profinite completion in mathematics in general. This connection underlies a number of recent results in automata theory including a generalization of Eilenberg-Reiterman theory for regular languages and a new notion of compact recognition applying beyond the setting of regular languages. The purpose of this paper is to give the underlying duality theoretic result in its general form. Further we illustrate the power of the result by providing a few applications in topological algebra and language theory. In particular, we give a simple proof of the fact that any topological algebra quotient of a profinite algebra which is again based on a Boolean space is in fact a profinite algebra and we derive the conditions dual to the ones of the original Eilenberg theorem in a fully modular manner.

He asked whether this system is complete. Prooftheoretic arguments attempting to show completeness of this equational system are complicated by the presence of a non-algebraic rule for solving fixed-point equations by using star iteration. We characterize the derivational power that the fixed-point rule adds to the purely equational part Mil \u0301 of Milner\u2019s system Mil: it corresponds to the power of coinductive proofs over Mil \u0301 that have the form of finite process graphs with the loop existence and elimination property LEE. We define a variant system cMil by replacing the fixed-point rule in Mil with a rule that permits LEE-shaped circular derivations in Mil \u0301 from previously derived equations as a premise. With this rule alone we also define the variant system CLC for combining LEE-shaped coinductive proofs over Mil \u0301. We show that both cMil and CLC have proof interpretations in Mil, and vice versa. As this correspondence links, in both directions, derivability in Mil with derivation trees of process graphs, it widens the space for graph-based approaches to finding a completeness proof of Milner\u2019s system.

The computation of iterations is in NP in the very general case, and is linear when local functions are monotonic, or with some usual representations of functions of BNs (binary decision diagrams, Petri nets, automata networks, etc.). Thus, reachability is in P with locally-monotonic BNs, and P$^{\\text{NP}}$ otherwise (instead of being PSPACE-complete with update modes); \n- deciding wherever a configuration belongs to an attractor is in coNP with locally-monotonic BNs, and coNP$^{\\text{coNP}}$ otherwise (instead of PSPACE-complete with update modes). \n \nFurthermore, we demonstrate that the semantics completely captures any behavior achievable with any multilevel or ODE refinement of the BN; and the semantics is minimal with respect to this model refinement criteria: to any most permissive trajectory, there exists a multilevel refinement of the BN which can reproduce it. \n \nIn brief, the most permissive semantics of BNs enables a correct abstract reasoning on dynamics of BNs, with a greater tractability than previously introduced update modes.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Thomas  Chatain", "Stefan  Haar", "Lo\u00efc  Paulev\u00e9"], "year": 2018, "n_citations": 3}

For instance, the regular spanners are the closure under the Relational Algebra (RA) of the regular expressions with capture variables, and the expressive power of the regular spanners is precisely captured by the class of vset-automata - a restricted class of transducers that mark the endpoints of selected spans. \nIn this work, we embark on the investigation of document spanners that can annotate extractions with auxiliary information such as confidence, support, and confidentiality measures. To this end, we adopt the abstraction of provenance semirings by Green et al., where tuples of a relation are annotated with the elements of a commutative semiring, and where the annotation propagates through the (positive) RA operators via the semiring operators. Hence, the proposed spanner extension, referred to as an annotator, maps every string into an annotated relation over the spans. As a specific instantiation, we explore weighted vset-automata that, similarly to weighted automata and transducers, attach semiring elements to transitions. We investigate key aspects of expressiveness, such as the closure under the positive RA, and key aspects of computational complexity, such as the enumeration of annotated answers and their ranked enumeration in the case of numeric semirings.

The framework of Hybrid automata---introduced by Alur, Courcoubetis, Henzinger, and Ho---provides a formal modeling and specification environment to analyze the interaction between the discrete and continuous parts of a cyber-physical system. Hybrid automata can be considered as generalizations of finite state automata augmented with a finite set of real-valued variables whose dynamics in each state is governed by a system of ordinary differential equations. Moreover, the discrete transitions of hybrid automata are guarded by constraints over the values of these real-valued variables, and enable discontinuous jumps in the evolution of these variables.

A word equation relates two words over string variables and constants. Its solution amounts to a function mapping variables to constant strings that equate the left and right hand sides of the equation. While the problem of solving word equations is decidable, the decidability of the problem of solving a word equation with a length constraint (i.e., a constraint relating the lengths of words in the word equation) has remained a long-standing open problem. In this paper, we focus on the subclass of quadratic word equations, i.e., in which each variable occurs at most twice. We first show that the length abstractions of solutions to quadratic word equations are in general not Presburger-definable. We then describe a class of counter systems with Presburger transition relations which capture the length abstraction of a quadratic word equation with regular constraints. We provide an encoding of the effect of a simple loop of the counter systems in the theory of existential Presburger Arithmetic with divisibility (PAD). Since PAD is decidable, we get a decision procedure for quadratic words equations with length constraints for which the associated counter system is \\emph{flat} (i.e., all nodes belong to at most one cycle). We show a decidability result (in fact, also an NP algorithm with a PAD oracle) for a recently proposed NP-complete fragment of word equations called regular-oriented word equations, together with length constraints.

Due to the consideration of environment and motion uncertainties, we model the robot motion as a probabilistic labeled Markov decision process (PL-MDP) with unknown transition probabilities and probabilistic labeling functions. The LTL task specification is converted to a limit deterministic generalized B\u00fcchi automaton (LDGBA) with several accepting sets to maintain dense rewards during learning. The novelty of applying LDGBA is to construct an embedded LDGBA (E-LDGBA) by designing a synchronous tracking-frontier function, which enables the record of non-visited accepting sets of LDGBA at each round of the repeated visiting pattern, to overcome the difficulties of directly applying conventional LDGBA. With appropriate dependent reward and discount functions, rigorous analysis shows that any method, which optimizes the expected discount return of the RL-based approach, is guaranteed to find the optimal policy to maximize the satisfaction probability of the LTL specifications. A model-free RL-based motion planning strategy is developed to generate the optimal policy in this paper.

The separating automata corresponding to three of the algorithms are deterministic, and it is clear that deterministic separating automata can be used to solve parity games. The separating automaton corresponding to the algorithm of Lehtinen is nondeterministic, though. While this particular automaton can be used to solve parity games, this is not true for every nondeterministic separating automaton. As a first (more conceptual) contribution, we specify when a nondeterministic separating automaton can be used to solve parity games. \nWe also repeat the correctness proof of the Lehtinen's algorithm, using separating automata.

A (symbolic) path is given as a finite sequence of assignments and assertions (i.e. without loops), and checking its feasibility amounts to determining the existence of inputs that yield a successful execution. Modern programming languages (e.g. JavaScript, PHP, and Python) support many complex string operations, and strings are also often implicitly modified during a computation in some intricate fashion (e.g. by some autoescaping mechanisms). In this paper we provide two general semantic conditions which together ensure the decidability of path feasibility: (1) each assertion admits regular monadic decomposition (i.e. is an effectively recognisable relation), and (2) each assignment uses a (possibly nondeterministic) function whose inverse relation preserves regularity. We show that the semantic conditions are expressive since they are satisfied by a multitude of string operations including concatenation, one-way and two-way finite-state transducers, replaceall functions (where the replacement string could contain variables), string-reverse functions, regular-expression matching, and some (restricted) forms of letter-counting/length functions. The semantic conditions also strictly subsume existing decidable string theories (e.g. straight-line fragments, and acyclic logics), and most existing benchmarks (e.g. most of Kaluza\u2019s, and all of SLOG\u2019s, Stranger\u2019s, and SLOTH\u2019s benchmarks). Our semantic conditions also yield a conceptually simple decision procedure, as well as an extensible architecture of a string solver in that a user may easily incorporate his/her own string functions into the solver by simply providing code for the pre-image computation without worrying about other parts of the solver. Despite these, the semantic conditions are unfortunately too general to provide a fast and complete decision procedure. We provide strong theoretical evidence for this in the form of complexity results. To rectify this problem, we propose two solutions. Our main solution is to allow only partial string functions (i.e., prohibit nondeterminism) in condition (2). This restriction is satisfied in many cases in practice, and yields decision procedures that are effective in both theory and practice. Whenever nondeterministic functions are still needed (e.g. the string function split), our second solution is to provide a syntactic fragment that provides a support of nondeterministic functions, and operations like one-way transducers, replaceall (with constant replacement string), the string-reverse function, concatenation, and regular-expression matching. We show that this fragment can be reduced to an existing solver SLOTH that exploits fast model checking algorithms like IC3. We provide an efficient implementation of our decision procedure (assuming our first solution above, i.e., deterministic partial string functions) in a new string solver OSTRICH. Our implementation provides built-in support for concatenation, reverse, functional transducers (FFT), and replaceall and provides a framework for extensibility to support further string functions.

The notion of electronic contracts has emerged mostly due to technological advances and the electronic trading among companies and customers. Thereby new challenges have arisen to guarantee reliability among the stakeholders in electronic negotiations. In this scenery, the automatic verification of electronic contracts appeared as the solution but as a new challenge at the same time. An important task on verifying contracts is concerned of detecting conflicts in multi-party contracts. The problem of checking contracts has been largely addressed in the literature, but we are not aware about any method and tool that deals with multi-party contracts and conflict detection using a contract language. This work presents an automatic checker, so-called RECALL, for finding conflicts on multi-party contracts modeled by an extension of a contract language. We developed an automatic checking tool and also applied it to a a well-known case study of selling products that is characterized by multi-party aspects of the contracts.

A crucial parameter of a distributed system is the kind of interaction that is allowed between processes. In this lecture, we focus on the message-passing paradigm. In general, communication in a distributed system creates complex dependencies between events, which are hidden when using a sequential, operational semantics.

The central algorithmic problem for Petri nets is reachability: whether from the given initial configuration there exists a sequence of valid execution steps that reaches the given final configuration. The complexity of the problem has remained unsettled since the 1960s, and it is one of the most prominent open questions in the theory of verification. Decidability was proved by Mayr in his seminal STOC 1981 work, and the currently best published upper bound is non-primitive recursive Ackermannian of Leroux and Schmitz from LICS 2019. We establish a non-elementary lower bound, i.e. that the reachability problem needs a tower of exponentials of time and space. Until this work, the best lower bound has been exponential space, due to Lipton in 1976. The new lower bound is a major breakthrough for several reasons. Firstly, it shows that the reachability problem is much harder than the coverability (i.e., state reachability) problem, which is also ubiquitous but has been known to be complete for exponential space since the late 1970s. Secondly, it implies that a plethora of problems from formal languages, logic, concurrent systems, process calculi and other areas, that are known to admit reductions from the Petri nets reachability problem, are also not elementary. Thirdly, it makes obsolete the currently best lower bounds for the reachability problems for two key extensions of Petri nets: with branching and with a pushdown stack. At the heart of our proof is a novel gadget so called the factorial amplifier that, assuming availability of counters that are zero testable and bounded by k, guarantees to produce arbitrarily large pairs of values whose ratio is exactly the factorial of k. We also develop a novel construction that uses arbitrarily large pairs of values with ratio R to provide zero testable counters that are bounded by R. Repeatedly composing the factorial amplifier with itself by means of the construction then enables us to compute in linear time Petri nets that simulate Minsky machines whose counters are bounded by a tower of exponentials, which yields the non-elementary lower bound. By refining this scheme further, we in fact establish hardness for h-exponential space already for Petri nets with h + 13 counters.", "venue": "STOC", "authors": ["Wojciech  Czerwinski", "Slawomir  Lasota", "Ranko  Lazic", "J\u00e9r\u00f4me  Leroux", "Filip  Mazowiecki"], "year": 2019, "n_citations": 90}

However, Esparza and Reiter only show (proper) inclusions between the classes, and so do not characterise their decision power. In this paper we do so for labelling properties, i.e. properties that depend only on the labels of the nodes, but not on the structure of the graph. In particular, majority (whether more nodes carry label a than b) is a labelling property. Our results show that only one of the seven equivalence classes identified by Esparza and Reiter can decide majority for arbitrary networks. We then study the expressive power of the classes on bounded-degree networks, and show that three classes can. In particular, we present an algorithm for majority that works for all bounded-degree networks under adversarial schedulers, i.e. even if the scheduler must only satisfy that every node makes a move infinitely often, and prove that no such algorithm can work for arbitrary networks.", "venue": "PODC", "authors": ["Philipp  Czerner", "Roland  Guttenberg", "Martin  Helfrich", "Javier  Esparza"], "year": 2021, "n_citations": 0}

In wireless NCSs, the communication between sensors, controllers, and actuators is supported by a communication channel that is likely to introduce variable communication delays, packet losses, limited bandwidth, and other practical nonidealities leading to numerous technical challenges. Although stability properties of NCSs have been investigated extensively in the literature, results for NCSs under more complex and general objectives, and, in particular, results dealing with verification or controller synthesis for logical specifications, are much more limited. This paper investigates how to address such complex objectives by constructively deriving symbolic models of NCSs, while encompassing the mentioned network nonidealities. The obtained abstracted (symbolic) models can then be employed to synthesize hybrid controllers enforcing rich logical specifications over the concrete NCS models. Examples of such general specifications include properties expressed as formulas in linear temporal logic or as automata on infinite strings. We thus provide a general synthesis framework that can be flexibly adapted to a number of NCS setups.

Some unanswered questions are related to the computational power of such systems, and finding a characterization of the class of circular languages generated by circular splicing systems is still an open problem. In this paper we solve this problem for complete systems, which are special finite circular splicing systems. We show that a circular language L is generated by a complete system if and only if the set Lin(L) of all words corresponding to L is a pure unitary language generated by a set closed under the conjugacy relation. The class of pure unitary languages was introduced by A. Ehrenfeucht, D. Haussler, G.

As a direct consequence, we characterize (regular) circular languages generated by complete systems. We can also decide whether the language generated by a complete system is regular. Finally, we point out that complete systems have the same computational power as finite simple systems, an easy type of circular splicing system defined in the literature from the very beginning, when only one rule is allowed.

Reinforcement learning algorithms, in contrast, are designed to learn an optimal policy when the transition probabilities of the MDP are unknown, but require the user to associate local rewards with transitions. The appeal of highlevel temporal logic specifications has motivated research to develop RL algorithms for synthesis of policies from specifications. To understand the techniques, and nuanced variations in their theoretical guarantees, in the growing body of resulting literature, we develop a formal framework for defining transformations among RL tasks with different forms of objectives. We define the notion of sampling-based reduction to relate two MDPs whose transition probabilities can be learnt by sampling, followed by formalization of preservation of optimal policies, convergence, and robustness. We then use our framework to restate known results, establish new results to fill in some gaps, and identify open problems.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Rajeev  Alur", "Suguman  Bansal", "Osbert  Bastani", "Kishor  Jothimurugan"], "year": 2021, "n_citations": 1}

Indirect reduction means the graph to be colored is not reduced to an LR(1) state machine directly. Instead, it is reduced to a context-free grammar from which an LR(1) state machine is derived. Furthermore, by considering the nodes in the graph to be colored one at a time, the context-free grammar is incrementally extended from a template context-free grammar that is for a two-node graph.

Each binary word has an associated set of Parikh vectors of the factors of the word. Using prefix normal words, we provide a characterization of the equivalence class of binary words having the same set of Parikh vectors of their factors.

We propose an approach to build such systems by relying on the concepts of multiagent systems, Peer to Peer (P2P) architecture, Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) and structured documents (artifacts) cooperative edition. Indeed, we develop mathematical tools that allow any workflow systems designer, to express each administrative process in the form of an attributed grammar whose symbols represent tasks to be executed, productions specify a scheduling of these tasks, and instances (the derivation trees that conform to it) represent the different execution scenarios leading to business goal states. The obtained grammatical model is then introduced into a proposed P2P system which is in charge of carrying out the completely decentralised execution of the underlying process's instances. The said system orchestrates a process's instance execution as a choreography during which, various software agents driven by human agents (actors), coordinate themselves through artifacts that they collectively edit. The exchanged artifacts represent the system's memory: they provide information on already executed tasks, on those ready to be executed and on their executors. The software agents are autonomous and identical: they execute the same unique protocol each time they receive an artifact. This protocol allows them to identify the tasks they must immediately execute, to execute them, to update the artifact and to disseminate it if necessary, for the continuation of the execution. Moreover, actors potentially have only a partial perception of processes in which they are involved. In practice, this means that certain tasks can be carried out confidentially.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Milliam Maxime Zekeng Ndadji"], "year": 2021, "n_citations": 0}

The framework is largely inspired by the control of a biological system, namely a population of yeasts, where the controller may only change the environment common to all cells. We study a synchronisation problem for such populations: no matter how individual agents react to the actions of the controller, the controller aims at driving all agents synchronously to a target state. The agents are naturally represented by a non-deterministic finite state automaton (NFA), the same for every agent, and the whole system is encoded as a 2-player game. The first player (Controller) chooses actions, and the second player (Agents) resolves non-determinism for each agent. The game with m agents is called the m -population game. This gives rise to a parameterized control problem (where control refers to 2 player games), namely the population control problem: can Controller control the m-population game for all m in N whatever Agents does?", "venue": "CONCUR", "authors": ["Nathalie  Bertrand", "Miheer  Dewaskar", "Blaise  Genest", "Hugo  Gimbert"], "year": 2017, "n_citations": 10}

An important type of repeated sequences common in the human genome are tandem repeats, where identical copies appear next to each other.

In particular, based on a celebrated result by Axel Thue from 1906, presenting a construction for ternary squarefree sequences, we show that for alphabets of size 4 or larger, bounded tandem duplication systems, regardless of the seed and the bound on duplication length, are not fully expressive, i.e. they cannot generate all strings even as substrings of other strings. Note that the alphabet of size 4 is of particular interest as it pertains to the genomic alphabet. Building on this result, we also show that these systems do not have full capacity. In general, our results illustrate that duplication lengths play a more significant role than the seed in generating a large number of sequences for these systems.", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Information Theory", "authors": ["Siddharth  Jain", "Farzad  Farnoud Hassanzadeh", "Jehoshua  Bruck"], "year": 2017, "n_citations": 32}

Automata accepting languages from the lowest levels of these hierarchies arise naturally in the context of model checking. We identify a dichotomy in the dot-depth hierarchy by showing that the problem is already NP-complete when all input automata accept languages of the levels B0 or B1/2 and already PSPACE-hard when all automata accept a language from the level B1. Conversely, we identify a tetrachotomy in the Straubing-Th\u00e9rien hierarchy.

In this paper, we replace the single tape of 1-way 2-head quantum finite state automaton with two tapes. The content of the second tape is determined using a relation defined on input alphabet. The main claims of this paper are as follows: (1)We establish that 2-tape 1-way quantum finite state automaton(2T1QFA(2)) can accept all regular languages (2)A language which cannot be accepted by any multi-head deterministic finite automaton can be accepted by 2-tape 1-way quantum finite state automaton(2T1QFA(2)) .(3) Exploiting the superposition property of quantum automata we show that 2-tape 1-way quantum finite state automaton(2T1QFA(2)) can accept the language L=ww.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Debayan  Ganguly", "Kumar Sankar Ray"], "year": 2016, "n_citations": 1}

In the first one, agents are considered to be fully rational and systems are seen as multi-player games. In the second one, agents are considered to be fully stochastic processes and the system itself is seen as a large stochastic process. From the standpoint of a particular agent - having to choose a strategy, the choice of the paradigm is crucial: the most adequate strategy depends on the assumptions made on the other agents. \nIn this paper, we focus on two-player games and their application to the automated synthesis of reliable controllers for reactive systems - a field at the crossroads between computer science and mathematics. In this setting, the reactive system to control is a player, and its environment is its opponent, usually assumed to be fully antagonistic or fully stochastic. We illustrate several recent developments aiming to breach this narrow taxonomy by providing formal concepts and mathematical frameworks to reason about richer behavioral models. \nThe interest of such models is not limited to reactive system synthesis but extends to other application fields of game theory.

The motivation for introducing them was a desired correlation between the automaton states and right congruence relations, in a manner similar to the Myhill-Nerode theorem for regular languages. This correlation is beneficial for learning algorithms, and indeed it was recently shown that omega-regular languages can be learned from membership and equivalence queries, using FDFAs as the acceptors. \n \nIn this paper, we look into the question of how suitable FDFAs are for defining omega-regular languages. Specifically, we look into the complexity of performing Boolean operations, such as complementation and intersection, on FDFAs, the complexity of solving decision problems, such as emptiness and language containment, and the succinctness of FDFAs compared to standard deterministic and nondeterministic omega-automata. \n \nWe show that FDFAs enjoy the benefits of deterministic automata with respect to Boolean operations and decision problems. Namely, they can all be performed in nondeterministic logarithmic space. \nWe provide polynomial translations of deterministic Buchi and coBuchi automata to FDFAs and of FDFAs to nondeterministic Buchi automata (NBAs). We show that translation of an NBA to an FDFA may involve an exponential blowup.

We propose a type system for this calculus that models how the presence of positive and negative catalysers can modify these speeds. We claim that types are the right abstraction in order to represent the interaction between elements without specifying exactly the element positions. Our claim is supported through an example modelling the lactose operon. The Calculus of Looping Sequences (CLS for short) [4, 5, 19], is a formalism for describing biological systems and their evolution. CLS is based on term rewriting, given a set of predefined rules modelling the activities one would like to describe. The model has been extended with several features, such as a commutative parallel composition operator, and some semantic means, such as bisimulations [5, 7], which are common in process calculi. This permits to combine the simplicity of notation of rewrite systems with the advantage of a form of compositionality. A Stochastic version of CLS (SCLS for short) is proposed in [6]. Rates are associated with rewrite rules in order to model the speed of the described activities. Therefore, transitions derived in S CLS are driven by a rate that models the parameter of an exponential distribution and characterizes the stoch astic behaviour of the transition. The choice of the next rule to be applied and of the time of its applicatio n is based on the classical Gillespie\u2019s algorithm [15]. Defining a stochastic semantics for CLS requires a correct en umeration of all the possible and distinct ways to apply each rewrite rule within a term. A single pattern may have several, though isomorphic, matches within a CLS term. In this paper, we simplify the counting mechanism used in [6] by imposing some restrictions on the patterns modelling the rewrite rul es. Each rewrite rule states explicitly the types of the elements whose occurrence are able to speed-up or slow-down a reaction. The occurrences of the elements of these types are then processed by a rate function (instead of a rate constant) which is used to compute the actual rate of a transition. We show how we can define patterns in our typed stochastic framework to model some common biological activities, and, in particular, we underline the possibility to combine the modelling of positive and negative catalysers within a single rule by reproducing a general case of osmosis. Finally, as a complete modelling application, we show the expressiveness of our formalism by describing the lactose operon in Escherichia Coli.", "venue": "MeCBIC", "authors": ["Mariangiola  Dezani-Ciancaglini", "Paola  Giannini", "Angelo  Troina"], "year": 2009, "n_citations": 14}

So far, the conversion of LTLf formulas to deterministic finite-state automata (DFAs) has been identified as the primary bottleneck to the scalabity of synthesis. Recent investigations have also shown that the size of the DFA state space plays a critical role in synthesis as well.Therefore, effective resolution of the bottleneck for synthesis requires the conversion to be time and memory performant, and prevent state-space explosion. Current conversion approaches, however, which are based either on explicit-state representation or symbolic-state representation, fail to address these necessities adequately at scale: Explicit-state approaches generate minimal DFA but are slow due to expensive DFA minimization. Symbolic-state representations can be succinct, but due to the lack of DFA minimization they generate such large state spaces that even their symbolic representations cannot compensate for the blow-up.This work proposes a hybrid representation approach for the conversion. Our approach utilizes both explicit and symbolic representations of the state-space, and effectively leverages their complementary strengths. In doing so, we offer an LTLf to DFA conversion technique that addresses all three necessities, hence resolving the bottleneck.

Along this path, Wheeler graphs have been recently introduced as an extension/adaptation of the Burrows-Wheeler Transform (the now famous BWT, originally defined on strings) to graphs. These graphs constitute an important data-structure for languages, since they allow a very efficient storage mechanism for the transition function of an automaton, while providing a fast support to all sorts of substring queries. This is possible as a consequence of a property\u2014the so-called path coherence\u2014valid on Wheeler graphs and consisting in an ordering on nodes that \u201cpropagates\u201d to (collections of) strings. By looking at a Wheeler graph as an automaton, the ordering on strings corresponds to the co-lexicographic order of the words entering each state. This leads naturally to consider the class of regular languages accepted by Wheeler automata, i.e. the Wheeler languages. It has been shown that, as opposed to the general case, the classic determinization by powerset construction is polynomial on Wheeler languages. As a consequence, most of the classical problems turn out to be \u201ceasy\u201d\u2014 that is, solvable in polynomial time\u2014on Wheeler languages. Moreover, deciding whether a DFA is Wheeler and deciding whether a DFA accepts a Wheeler language is polynomial. Our contribution here is to put an upper bound to easy problems.

To compensate the lack of knowledge on the supervisor, we assume that the adversary has recorded a (prefix-closed) finite set of observations of the runs of the closed-loop system, which can be used for assisting the synthesis. We present a heuristic algorithm for the synthesis of covert damage-reachable attackers, based on the model of the plant and the (finite) set of observations, by a transformation into solving an instance of the partial-observation supervisor synthesis problem. The heuristic algorithm developed in this paper may allow the adversary to synthesize covert attackers without having to know the model of the supervisor, which could be hard to obtain in practice. For simplicity, we shall only consider covert attackers that are able to carry out sensor replacement attacks and actuator disablement attacks. The effectiveness of our approach is illustrated on a water tank example adapted from the literature.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Liyong  Lin", "Ruochen  Tai", "Yuting  Zhu", "Rong  Su"], "year": 2021, "n_citations": 2}

Applications of these types of automata include software security analysis and natural language processing. While these models provide means to describe words over infinite input alphabets, there is no considerable work on symbolic output (as present in transducers) alphabets, or even abstraction (widening) thereof. Furthermore, established approaches for transforming, for example, minimizing or reducing, finite-state machines that produce output on states or transitions are not applicable. A notion of equivalence of this type of machines is needed to make statements about whether or not transformations maintain the semantics. We present abstract transducers as a new form of finite-state transducers. Both their input alphabet and the output alphabet is composed of abstract words, where one abstract word represents a set of concrete words. The mapping between these representations is described by abstract word domains. By using words instead of single letters, abstract transducers provide the possibility of lookaheads to decide on state transitions to conduct. Since both the input symbol and the output symbol on each transition is an abstract entity, abstraction techniques can be applied naturally. We apply abstract transducers as the foundation for sharing task artifacts for reuse in context of program analysis and verification, and describe task artifacts as abstract words.

In this paper, we study the decidability of the equivalence of multi-letter QFAs, and the main technical contributions are as follows: (1) We show that any two automata, a $k_{1}$-letter QFA ${\\cal A}_1$ and a $k_{2}$-letter QFA ${\\cal A}_2$, over the same input alphabet $\\Sigma$ are equivalent if and only if they are $(n^2m^{k-1}-m^{k-1}+k)$-equivalent, where $m=|\\Sigma|$ is the cardinality of $\\Sigma$, $k=\\max(k_{1},k_{2})$, and $n=n_{1}+n_{2}$, with $n_{1}$ and $n_{2}$ being the numbers of states of ${\\cal A}_{1}$ and ${\\cal A}_{2}$, respectively. When $k=1$, we obtain the decidability of equivalence of measure-once QFAs in the literature. It is worth mentioning that our technical method is essentially different from that for the decidability of the case of single input alphabet (i.e., $m=1$). (2) However, if we determine the equivalence of multi-letter QFAs by checking all strings of length not more than $ n^2m^{k-1}-m^{k-1}+k$, then the worst time complexity is exponential, i.e., $O(n^6m^{n^2m^{k-1}-m^{k-1}+2k-1})$. Therefore, we design a polynomial-time $O(m^{2k-1}n^{8}+km^kn^{6})$ algorithm for determining the equivalence of any two multi-letter QFAs.

We refer to this offspring of BNF as Math-BNF or MBNF, to the original BNF and its notational variants just as BNF, and to aspects common to both as BNF-style. What all BNF-style notations share is the use of production rules roughly of this form: $$\\bullet \\mathrel{::=} \\circ_1 \\mid \\cdots \\mid \\circ_n $$ Normally, such a rule says \"every instance of $\\circ_i$ for $i \\in \\{1, \\ldots, n\\}$ is also an in stance of $\\bullet$\". MBNF is distinct from BNF in the entities and operations it allows. Instead of strings, MBNF builds arrangements of symbols that we call math-text. Sometimes \"syntax\" is defined by interleaving MBNF production rules and other mathematical definitions that can contain chunks of math-text. There is no clear definition of MBNF. Readers do not have a document which tells them how MBNF is to be read and must learn MBNF through a process of cultural initiation. To the extent that MBNF is defined, it is largely through examples scattered throughout the literature and which require readers to guess the mathematical structures underpinning them.

We show that pushdown modular games are undecidable in general, and become decidable for visibly pushdown automata specifications. Our solution relies on a reduction to modular games with finite-state winning conditions. We carefully characterize the computational complexity of this decision problem by also considering as winning conditions nondeterministic and universal Buchi or co-Buchi visibly pushdown automata, and CaRet or Nwtl temporal logic formulas.

It has been argued that promise problems should be seen as partial decision problems and as such that they are more fundamental than decision problems and formal languages that used to be considered as the basic ones for complexity theory. The main purpose of this paper is to explore the promise problems accepted by classical, quantum and also semi-quantum finite automata. More specifically, we first introduce two acceptance modes of promise problems, recognizability and solvability, and explore their basic properties. Afterwards, we show several results concerning descriptional complexity on promise problems. In particular, we prove: (1) there is a promise problem that can be recognized exactly by measure-once one-way quantum finite automata (MO-1QFA), but no deterministic finite automata (DFA) can recognize it; (2) there is a promise problem that can be solved with error probability $\\epsilon\\leq 1/3$ by one-way finite automaton with quantum and classical states (1QCFA), but no one-way probability finite automaton (PFA) can solve it with error probability $\\epsilon\\leq 1/3$; and especially, (3) there are promise problems $A(p)$ with prime $p$ that can be solved {\\em with any error probability} by MO-1QFA with only two quantum basis states, but they can not be solved exactly by any MO-1QFA with two quantum basis states; in contrast, the minimal PFA solving $A(p)$ with any error probability (usually smaller than $1/2$) has $p$ states.

Existing methods for solving this problem can be described as search procedures for an invariant whose quantification prefix fits a particular template. We propose an alternative constructive approach that does not prescribe, a priori, a specific quantifier prefix. Instead, the required prefix is automatically inferred without any search by carefully analyzing the structural symmetries of the protocol. The key insight underlying this approach is that symmetry and quantification are closely related concepts that express protocol invariance under different re-arrangements of its components. We propose symmetric incremental induction, an extension of the finite-domain IC3/PDR algorithm, that automatically derives the required quantified inductive invariant by exploiting the connection between symmetry and quantification. While various attempts have been made to exploit symmetry in verification applications, to our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a direct link between symmetry and quantification in the context of clause learning during incremental induction. We also describe a procedure to automatically find a minimal finite size, the cutoff, that yields a quantified invariant proving safety for any size.

In a series of recent papers it has been shown that reachability in this model is PSPACE-complete [Esparza, Ganty, Majumdar'13] and that liveness is decidable in NEXPTIME [Durand-Gasselin, Esparza, Ganty, Majumdar'15]. We show here that the liveness problem is PSPACE-complete. We also introduce the universal reachability problem. We show that it is decidable, and coNEXPTIME-complete. Finally, using these results, we prove that the verifying regular properties of traces of executions, satisfying some stuttering condition, is also decidable in NEXPTIME for this model.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Marie  Fortin", "Anca  Muscholl", "Igor  Walukiewicz"], "year": 2016, "n_citations": 6}
