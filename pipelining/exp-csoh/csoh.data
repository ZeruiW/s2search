Bugs within both the parser and the format specification mean that a compliant file may fail to parse, or that a non-compliant file might be read without any apparent trouble. The latter situation presents a significant security risk, and should be avoided. This paper suggests that a better way to assess format specification compliance is to examine the set of error messages produced by a set of parsers rather than a single parser. If both a sample of compliant files and a sample of non-compliant files are available, then we show how a statistical test based on a pseudo-likelihood ratio can be very effective at determining a file\u2019s compliance and safety. Our method is format agnostic, and does not directly rely upon a formal specification of the format. Although this paper focuses upon the case of the PDF format (ISO 32000-2), we make no attempt to use any specific details of the format. Furthermore, we show how principal components analysis can be useful for a format specification designer to assess the quality and structure of these samples of files and parsers. While these tests are absolutely rudimentary, it appears that their use to measure file format variability and to identify non-compliant files is both novel and surprisingly effective.", "venue": "2021 IEEE Security and Privacy Workshops (SPW)", "authors": ["Michael  Robinson"], "year": 2021, "n_citations": 1}

With the rapid development of the technology and adaptation of CAV, it is critical to developing the universal evaluation method and the testing standard which could evaluate the impacts on energy consumption and environmental pollution of CAV fairly, especially under the various traffic conditions. In this paper, we proposed a new method and framework to evaluate the energy efficiency and emission of the vehicle based on the unsupervised learning methods. Both the real-world driving data of the evaluated vehicle and the large naturalistic driving dataset are used to perform the driving primitive analysis and coupling. Then the linear weighted estimation method could be used to calculate the testing result of the evaluated vehicle. The results show that this method can successfully identify the typical driving primitives. The couples of the driving primitives from the evaluated vehicle and the typical driving primitives from the large real-world driving dataset coincide with each other very well.

Considerable effort has been expended in the EDA community during the past several years in trying to cope with the so-called statistical timing problem. Most of this effort has been aimed at generalizing the static timing analyzers to the statistical case. In this paper, we take a pragmatic approach in pursuit of making the Monte Carlo method for timing yield estimation practically feasible. The Monte Carlo method is widely used as a golden reference in assessing the accuracy of other timing yield estimation techniques. However, it is generally believed that it can not be used in practice for estimating timing yield as it requires too many costly full circuit simulations for acceptable accuracy. In this paper, we present a novel approach to constructing an improvedMonte Carlo estimator for timing yield which provides the same accuracy as the standard Monte Carlo estimator, but at a cost of much fewer full circuit simulations. This improved estimator is based on a novel combination of a variance reduction technique, importance sampling, and a stochastic generalization of the logical effort formalism for cheap but approximate delay estimation. The results we present demonstrate that our improved yield estimator achieves the same accuracy as the standard Monte Carlo estimator at a cost reduction reaching several orders of magnitude.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Alp Arslan Bayrakci", "Alper  Demir", "Serdar  Tasiran"], "year": 2008, "n_citations": 2}

This starts with placement optimization aimed at improving routability, wirelength, congestion and timing in the design. Contrarily, no such practice exists on a floorplanned layout, during the early stage of the design flow. Recently, STAIRoute \\cite{karb2} aimed to address that by identifying the shortest routing path of a net through a set of routing regions in the floorplan in multiple metal layers. Since the blocks in hierarchical ASIC/SoC designs do not use all the permissible routing layers for the internal routing corresponding to standard cell connectivity, the proposed STAIRoute framework is not an effective for early global routability assessment. This leads to improper utilization of routing area, specifically in higher routing layers with fewer routing blockages, as the lack of placement of standard cells does not facilitates any routing of their interconnections. \nThis paper presents a generalized model for early global routability assessment, HGR, by utilizing the free regions over the blocks beyond certain metal layers. The proposed (hybrid) routing model comprises of (a) the junction graph model in STAIRoute routing through the block boundary regions in lower routing layers, and (ii) the grid graph model for routing in higher layers over the free regions of the blocks. \nExperiment with the latest floorplanning benchmarks exhibit an average reduction of $4\\%$, $54\\%$ and $70\\%$ in netlength, via count, and congestion respectively when HGR is used over STAIRoute. Further, we conducted another experiment on an industrial design flow targeted for $45nm$ process, and the results are encouraging with $~3$X runtime boost when early global routing is used in conjunction with the existing physical design flow.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Bapi  Kar", "Susmita  Sur-Kolay", "Chittaranjan A.

In this study, we address this core limitation by presenting a multi-stage stochastic programming compartmental model, which integrates the uncertain disease progression and resource allocation to control an infectious disease outbreak. The proposed multi-stage stochastic program involves various disease growth scenarios and optimizes the distribution of treatment centers and resources while minimizing the total expected number of new infections and funerals. We define two new equity metrics, namely infection and capacity equity, and explicitly consider equity for allocating treatment funds and facilities over multiple time stages. We also study the multi-stage value of the stochastic solution (VSS), which demonstrates the superiority of the proposed stochastic programming model over its deterministic counterpart. We apply the proposed formulation to control the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia of West Africa to determine the optimal and fair resource-allocation strategies. Our model balances the proportion of infections over all regions, even without including the infection equity or prevalence equity constraints. Model results also show that allocating treatment resources proportional to population is sub-optimal, and enforcing such a resource allocation policy might adversely impact the total number of infections and deaths, and thus resulting in a high cost that we have to pay for the fairness. Our multi-stage stochastic epidemic-logistics model is practical and can be adapted to control other infectious diseases in meta-populations and dynamically evolving situations.", "venue": "medRxiv", "authors": ["Xuecheng  Yin", "I.

Existence of lithography weakpoints in a physical layout can cause manufacturability issues, which in turn can result in yield losses. In our experiments, we have found that specific standard cells have tendencies to create lithography weakpoints after their cell instances are placed and routed, even though each of these cells does not contain any lithography weakpoint before performing placement and routing. In addition, our experiments have shown that abutted standard cell instances can induce lithography weakpoints. Therefore, in this paper, we propose methodologies that are used in a novel software system for checking standard cells in terms of the aforementioned lithography issues. Specifically, the software system is capable of detecting and sorting problematic standard cells which are prone to generate lithography weakpoints, as well as reporting standard cells that should not be abutted.

Currently, scenario-based approaches are investigated in research and industry, aiming at a reduction of testing efforts by specifying safety relevant scenarios. To define those scenarios and operate in a complex real-world design domain, a structured description of the environment is needed. Within the PEGASUS research project, the 6-Layer Model (6LM) was introduced for the description of highway scenarios. This paper refines the 6LM and extends it to urban traffic and environment. As defined in PEGASUS, the 6LM provides the possibility to categorize the environment and, therefore, functions as a structured basis for subsequent scenario description. The model enables a structured description and categorization of the general environment, without incorporating any knowledge or anticipating any functions of actors. Beyond that, there is a variety of other applications of the 6LM, which are elaborated in this paper. The 6LM includes a description of the road network and traffic guidance objects, roadside structures, temporary modifications of the former, dynamic objects, environmental conditions and digital information. The work at hand specifies each layer by categorizing its items. Guidelines are formulated and explanatory examples are given to standardize the application of the model for an objective environment description. In contrast to previous publications, the model and its design are described in far more detail.

Furthermore, a detailed comparison of its performance with some of the other conventional Power Gating schemes; such as Cluster Based Sleep Transistor Design (CBSTD), Distributed Sleep Transistor Network (DSTN) etc.; has also been presented here. Considering the constraints of power consumption, performance, and the area overhead, while doing the actual implementation of any Power Gating scheme, it becomes important to deal with the various design issues like the proper sizing of the sleep transistors (STs), controlling the voltage drop (IR drop) across the STs, and obviously maintaining a desired performance with lower amount of delay degradation. With this notion, we tried to find out an efficient Power Gating strategy which can reduce the overall power consumption of any CMOS circuit by virtue of reducing the standby mode leakage current. Taking the different performance parameters into account, for an example circuit, which is actually the conventional 4x4 multiplier design, we found that the modified tunable sleep transistor cell Power Gating gives very much promising results.

Firstly, the low-level PCIe (PCI Express) layer responsible for the userspace interface for low-level operations such as memory mapping the PCIe BAR (Base Address Registers) and creating scatter-gather lists, which is provided by the PDA (Portable Driver Architecture) library developed by the Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies (FIAS). Above that sits our userspace driver which implements synchronization, controls the read-out card -- e.g. resetting and configuring the card, providing it with bus addresses to transfer data to and checking for data arrival -- and presents a uniform, high-level C++ interface that abstracts over the differences between the C-RORC and CRU. This interface -- of which direct usage is principally intended for high-performance read-out processes -- allows users to configure and use the various aspects of the read-out cards, such as configuration, DMA transfers and commands to the front-end.

To increase the various performances of noise removal, the AMMEM filter uses an adaptive size window, introduces two flexible factors, projection factor P and detection factor T, and limits the calculation scope of the AVG. The experimental results show the AMMEM filter makes a significant improvement in terms of noise detection, image restoration, and computational efficiency.

This is relevant because sooner or later we will all die; death affects us all. Studying the properties of living systems independently of their substrate, ALife describes life as a type of organization. Thus, death entails the loss of that organization. Within this perspective, different notions of death are derived from different notions of life. Also, the relationship between life and mind and the implications of death to the mind are discussed. A criterium is proposed in which the value of life depends on its uniqueness, i.e. a living system is more valuable if it is harder to replace. However, this does not imply that death in replaceable living systems is unproblematic. This is decided on whether there is harm to the system produced by death. The paper concludes with speculations about how the notion of death could be shaped in the future.", "venue": "Int. J. Artif.

Frequency-tuning is employed for a range of distances over which the loops are strongly coupled. In contrast, the impedance-tuned system employs varactor-based matching networks to compensate for changes in mutual inductance, and to achieve a simultaneous conjugate impedance match over a range of distances. The frequency-tuned system is simpler to implement, while the impedance-tuned system is more complex, but can achieve higher efficiencies.

A brief background to IPT Inductive Power Transfer technology and its applications is given and the design criteria for the paper are defined in detail. To be accurate, IPT data communication helps to reduce unnecessary wire connections and data is transmitted without any touch. Further the paper can be enhanced by looking for fault analysis inside the motor. This can be done by analyzing various parameters of the motor. A novel two-way IPT communication system was designed, which worked on the concept of pulsing the system on and off to send data serially.

In this context, parallel proximal algorithms and related alternating direction methods of multipliers have become popular optimization techniques to approximate iteratively the desired solution.

In this paper, it is shown that it is possible to relax these assumptions by considering a class of non-necessarily tight frame representations, thus offering the possibility of addressing a broader class of signal restoration problems. In particular, it is possible to use non-necessarily maximally decimated filter banks with perfect reconstruction, which are common tools in digital signal processing.

A Review of the Empirical Literature on Information Technology Outsourcing Relationship Satisfaction", "abstract": "There is growing recognition that the overall client-vendor relationship, and not only the contract, plays a critical role in Information Technology Outsourcing (ITO) success. However, our understanding of how ITO relationships function is limited. This paper contributes to this understanding by reviewing empirical literature on ITO success in terms of relationship satisfaction. A key finding is that the majority of reviewed studies concentrates on client satisfaction, thus neglecting the vendor perspective. We argue that this raises questions about the construct validity of these studies. Consequently, concerns exist about the validity and reliability of their empirical findings. Some scholars have acknowledged the problem and use a dyadic perspective. However, a review of these studies reveals that the authors have underestimated their contributions and do not explain why there is a problem. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to highlight their contributions by comparing the findings of the dyadic perspective studies with those of the \"client perspective\" research. In doing so, we assess whether the dyadic studies produce better explanations for ITO success than the client-oriented studies. We argue that this is indeed the case, by producing a better view on how underlying mechanisms of ITO relationships work.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Jorg  Verbaas"], "year": 2012, "n_citations": 0}

Unlike other industries, the key differentiator of electricity industry is the product itself. It can be produced but cannot be stored for future; production and consumption happen almost in near real-time. This particular peculiarity of the industry is the key driver for Machine Learning and Data Science based innovations in this industry. There is always a gap between the demand and supply in the electricity market across the globe. To fill the gap and improve the service efficiency through providing necessary supply to the market, commercial as well as federal electricity companies employ forecasting techniques to predict the future demand and try to meet the demand and provide curtailment guidelines to optimise the electricity consumption/demand.

One of the concepts for achieving this requirement is the design of resilient and survivable digital embedded systems. In the last two decades, development of self-healing digital systems based on molecular and cellular biology have received attention for the design of robust digital systems. However, many of these approaches have not been architected from the outset with safety in mind, nor have they been targeted for the applications of automation community where a significant need exists. This paper presents a new self-healing hardware architecture, inspired from the way nature responds, defends and heals: the stem cells in the immune system of living organisms, the life cycle of the living cell, and the pathway from Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) to protein. The proposed architecture is integrating cellular-based biological concepts, traditional fault tolerance techniques, and operational schematics for the international standard IEC 61131-3 to facilitate adoption in the automation industry and safety-critical applications. To date, two industrial applications have been mapped on the proposed architecture, which are capable of tolerating a significant number of faults that can stem from harsh environmental changes and external disturbances and we believe the nexus of its concepts can positively impact the next generation of critical systems in the automation industry", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Shawkat Sabah Khairullah"], "year": 2019, "n_citations": 0}

These chronic problems often fly under the radar of software monitoring systems before causing severe impacts (e.g. system failure). Therefore it's a challenging issue how to timely detect these problems to prevent system crash. Although a large quantity of approaches have been proposed to solve this issue, the accuracy and effectiveness of these approaches are still far from satisfactory due to the insufficiency of aging indicators adopted by them. In this paper, we present a novel entropy-based aging indicator, Multidimensional Multi-scale Entropy (MMSE). MMSE employs the complexity embedded in runtime performance metrics to indicate software aging and leverages multi-scale and multi-dimension integration to tolerate system fluctuations. Via theoretical proof and experimental evaluation, we demonstrate that MMSE satisfies Stability, Monotonicity and Integration which we conjecture that an ideal aging indicator should have. Based upon MMSE, we develop three failure detection approaches encapsulated in a proof-of-concept named CHAOS. The experimental evaluations in a Video on Demand (VoD) system and in a real-world production system, AntVision, show that CHAOS can detect the failure-prone state in an extraordinarily high accuracy and a near 0 Ahead-Time-To-Failure (ATTF). Compared to previous approaches, CHAOS improves the detection accuracy by about 5 times and reduces the ATTF even by 3 orders of magnitude.

Memory arrays are highly uniform and can be described by approximately 10 parameters depending mostly on the complexity of the periphery. Thus, to improve PPA utilization, memories are typically generated by memory compilers. A key task in the design flow of a chip is to find optimal memory compiler parametrizations that, on the one hand, fulfill system requirements while, on the other hand, they optimize PPA. Although most compiler vendors also provide optimizers for this task, these are often slow or inaccurate. To enable efficient optimization in spite of long compiler runtimes, we propose training fully connected feed-forward neural networks to predict PPA outputs given a memory compiler parametrization. Using an exhaustive search-based optimizer framework that obtains neural network predictions, PPA-optimal parametrizations are found within seconds after chip designers have specified their requirements.

As the suppliers seek to secure their intellectual property (IP) rights, the customer usually has no direct access to the suppliers' source code, and is able to enforce the use of verification tools only by legal requirements. In turn, the supplier has no means to convince the customer about successful verification without revealing the source code. This paper presents a new approach to resolve the conflict between the IP interests of the supplier and the quality interests of the customer. We introduce a protocol in which a dedicated server (called the \"amanat\") is controlled by both parties: the customer controls the verification task performed by the amanat, while the supplier controls the communication channels of the amanat to ensure that the amanat does not leak information about the source code. We argue that the protocol is both practically useful and mathematically sound. As the protocol is based on well-known (and relatively lightweight) cryptographic primitives, it allows a straightforward implementation on top of existing verification tool chains. To substantiate our security claims, we establish the correctness of the protocol by cryptographic reduction proofs.", "venue": "CAV", "authors": ["Sagar  Chaki", "Christian  Schallhart", "Helmut  Veith"], "year": 2007, "n_citations": 3}

The content of this article is a sub-proposal to the IEEE 802.15.7r1 Task Group (TG7r1) aimed at Optical Wireless Communication (OWC) using an image sensor as the receiver. The compatibility support is indispensable for Image Sensor Communications (ISC) because the rolling shutter image sensors currently available have different frame rates, shutter speeds, sampling rates, and resolutions. However, focusing on unidirectional communications (i.e., data broadcasting, beacons), an asynchronous communication prototype is also discussed in the paper. Due to the physical limitations associated with typical image sensors (including low and varying frame rates, long exposures, and low shutter speeds), the link speed performance is critically considered. Based on the practical measurement of camera response to modulated light, an operating frequency range is suggested along with the similar system architecture, decoding procedure, and algorithms. A significant feature of our novel data frame structure is that it can support both typical frame rate cameras (in the oversampling mode) as well as very low frame rate cameras (in the error detection mode for a camera whose frame rate is lower than the transmission packet rate). A high frame rate camera, i.e., no less than 20 fps, is supported in an oversampling mode in which a majority voting scheme for decoding data is applied. A low frame rate camera, i.e., when the frame rate drops to less than 20 fps at some certain time, is supported by an error detection mode in which any missing data sub-packet is detected in decoding and later corrected by external code.

However, little has been published about soft errors in uncore components, such as memory subsystem and I/O controllers, of a System-on-a-Chip (SoC).

We have created a new mixed-mode simulation platform that combines simulators at two different levels of abstraction, and achieves 20,000\u00d7 speedup over RTL-only simulation. Using this platform, we present the first study of the system-level impact of soft errors inside various uncore components of a large-scale, multi-core SoC using the industrial-grade, open-source OpenSPARC T2 SoC design. Our results show that soft errors in uncore components can significantly impact system-level reliability. We also demonstrate that uncore soft errors can create major challenges for traditional system-level checkpoint recovery techniques. To overcome such recovery challenges, we present a new replay recovery technique for uncore components belonging to the memory subsystem. For the L2 cache controller and the DRAM controller components of OpenSPARC T2, our new technique reduces the probability that an application run fails to produce correct results due to soft errors by more than 100\u00d7 with 3.32% and 6.09% chip-level area and power impact, respectively.", "venue": "2015 52nd ACM/EDAC/IEEE Design Automation Conference (DAC)", "authors": ["Hyungmin  Cho", "Chen-Yong  Cher", "Thomas  Shepherd", "Subhasish  Mitra"], "year": 2015, "n_citations": 15}

In the globalized world the importance of Information Systems (IS) and Information Technology (IT) become increasingly relevant regarding the requirements imposed by competition. Both the knowledge of the business as the rapid flow of information are fundamental for a enterprise decision making. Whereas the basic definition of IT = hardware + software, i.e., tools that has been used to create, store and disseminate data and information in the creation of knowledge, and IS = IT + People + procedures that collect, process and disseminate the information to support decision making, coordination, control, analysis and visualization in the organization [01], it makes implicit the understanding of IS is essential to create competitive companies, to manage global corporations and provide customers with products and services of value. In this work we are correlating IS with the governance of management of an ecosystem. Yet, as IT is redefining the foundations of business, then the customer service, operations, strategies of product marketing and its distribution and even the knowledge management (KM) depends very much, or sometimes even completely, on the IS. The IT and its costs have become a part of day-to-day business [02]. In order to meet this complexity of business needs, today is not possible to disregard the IT and its available resources, which makes very dificult to draw up IS. Therefore, the perspective view of the Sociotehcnical Aspects of an IS are directly concerned with governance and the model proposed regarding an ecosystem.

In particular, many modern embedded systems operate under tight memory space constraints. One way of satisfying these constraints is to compress executable code and data as much as possible. While research on code compression have studied efficient hardware and software based code strategies, many of these techniques do not take application behavior into account, that is, the same compression/decompression strategy is used irrespective of the application being optimized. This paper presents a code compression strategy based on control flow graph (CFG) representation of the embedded program. The idea is to start with a memory image wherein all basic blocks are compressed, and decompress only the blocks that are predicted to be needed in the near future. When the current access to a basic block is over, our approach also decides the point at which the block could be compressed.

This paper covers development of Acceleratable UVCs from standard UVCs for internal control and data buses of ST imaging group by partitioning of transaction-level components and cycle-accurate signal-level components between the software simulator and hardware accelerator respectively. Standard Co-Emulation API: Modeling Interface (SCE-MI) compliant, transaction-level communications link between test benches running on a host system and Emulation machine is established. Accelerated Verification IPs are used at UVM based Verification Environment of Image Signal Processing designs both with simulator and emulator as UVM acceleration is an extension of the standard simulation-only UVM and is fully backward compatible with it. Acceleratable UVCs significantly reduces development schedule risks while leveraging transaction models used during simulation. \nIn this paper, we discuss our experiences on UVM based methodology adoption on TestBench-Xpress(TBX) based technology step by step.

The difficulties revolve around guaranteeing loop termination and around learning how to properly sequence mutations to solve a problem.

For students that have been introduced to how to design programs using structural recursion, generative recursion, accumulative recursion, and mutation, the task of teaching them how to design while loops is made easier. These students are familiar, for example, with state variables, termination arguments, and accumulator invariants. All of these are fundamental in the design of while loops. This articles presents a novel technique used at Seton Hall University to introduce beginners to the design of while loops.

Online controlled experiments (aka AB tests) are increasingly being used to make decisions to improve websites as well as mobile and desktop applications. We argue that loss of telemetry data (during upload or post-processing) can skew the results of experiments, leading to loss of statistical power and inaccurate or erroneous conclusions. By systematically investigating the causes of telemetry loss, we argue that it is not practical to entirely eliminate it. Consequently, experimentation systems need to be robust to its effects. Furthermore, we note that it is nontrivial to measure the absolute level of telemetry loss in an experimentation system. In this paper, we take a top-down approach towards solving this problem. We motivate the impact of loss qualitatively using experiments in real applications deployed at scale, and formalize the problem by presenting a theoretical breakdown of the bias introduced by loss. Based on this foundation, we present a general framework for quantitatively evaluating the impact of telemetry loss, and present two solutions to measure the absolute levels of loss.

In studies about reasoning, feelings generated by near- misses are considered to introduce irrational bias (Wohl & Enzle, 2003; Dillon, Rogers & Tinsley, 2006). If rational agents are supposed to rely on objective probability only, then human sensitivity to near-misses indeed reveals a gross departure from rationality. Though the present study confirms the relative irrelevance of probability, we still suppose that the near-miss experience obeys definite laws. One of the most remarkable characteristics of near-misses is the human ability to recognize them and to extract all relevant parameters that contribute to making the situation emotional. In particular, though the missed situation has often no objective character (as it did not occur), its closeness to the actual situation is treated as objective by people (Kahneman & Varey, 1990). Since they are easily recognized, near-miss situations populate spontaneous conversations, as individuals systematically urge to share such emotional experiences (Rime, 2005). In near-misses, the actual situation is compared to a counterfactual one. The counterfactual alternative may be preferable or worse. The former case is associated with bad luck, while the latter generates feelings of good luck. In the present paper, we deal with bad luck situations exclusively. The symmetrical case can however be easily derived. In a previous study (Dessalles, 2010), the problem has been explored qualitatively in relation to Simplicity Theory. Participants were proposed short stories and were given the possibility to choose some parameter so as to make emotion maximum. For instance, Lucas had to lace up his shoes at 100m/200m/400m from the station, and then missed the train by five seconds. In this kind of story, a majority of participants choose the shortest distance, as predicted by the theory. The present paper offers two significant improve- ments. First, we concentrate on bare near-miss (i.e. without considering possible mutable causes of the failure, as in the Lucas story). Experiments are thus made simpler and more systematic thanks to a change of modality: we use graphical representations of the missing events and then we vary probability or distance to the target. The second improvement concerns the implementation of the theory, which is done more rigorously. In the next section, we mention the various factors that are known to influence near-miss emotion intensity, though they have not been included in a coherent theory yet. Then several experiments will be described that explore the role of the complexity (or simplicity) of outcomes. Then we give a short summary of simplicity theory and evaluate its predictions in near-miss situations. Determining Factors A variety of parameters have been found to control emotion intensity in the case of near-miss. The most obvious factor is the difference in \u2018utility\u2019 \u0394 v between the actual situation s 1 and the counterfactual s 2 (Teigen, 2005). Another acknowledged (but ill-defined) factor is the spatial or temporal \u2018closeness\u2019 D to the counterfactual (Kahneman & Varey, 1990; Teigen, 1996; Roese, 1997; Pritchard & Smith, 2004). Teigen (2005) represents these effects through the formula: L = \u0394 v / D, where L stands for emotion intensity. For some authors, the low probability of the actual event is crucial (Rescher, 1995). Other factors include controllability (Roese, 1997) and the mutability (i.e. modifiability) of causes (Kahneman & Miller, 1986; Byrne 2002). We designed a first test to confirm that the \u201crational\u201d approach, based exclusively on utility and probability, is unable to predict emotional judgment. Participants were asked to rank emotion in three similar situations where a young man broke his leg while on a one-week skiing holiday. A\u2019s accident occurred the first day, on the very first run; in case of B, it occurred the third day, at 14h30; for C,", "venue": "CogSci", "authors": ["Jean-Louis  Dessalles"], "year": 2011, "n_citations": 0}

However, F\u00fcgger et al. [IEEE TC 2016] proved that pure and inertial delays, which are employed for dynamic timing analysis in state-of-the-art tools like ModelSim, NC-Sim and VCS, do not yield faithful digital circuit models. Involution delays, which are based on delay functions that are mathematical involutions depending on the previous-output-to-input time offset, were introduced by F\u00fcgger et al. [DATE'15] as a faithful alternative (that can easily be used with existing tools). Although involution delays were shown to predict real signal traces reasonably accurately, any model with a deterministic delay function is naturally limited in its modeling power. In this paper, we thus extend the involution model, by adding non-deterministic delay variations (random or even adversarial), and prove analytically that faithfulness is not impaired by this generalization. Albeit the amount of non-determinism must be considerably restricted to ensure this property, the result is surprising: the involution model differs from non-faithful models mainly in handling fast glitch trains, where small delay shifts have large effects. This originally suggested that adding even small variations should break the faithfulness of the model, which turned out not to be the case. Moreover, the results of our simulations also confirm that this generalized involution model has larger modeling power and, hence, applicability.", "venue": "2018 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition (DATE)", "authors": ["Matthias  F\u00fcgger", "J\u00fcrgen  Maier", "Robert  Najvirt", "Thomas  Nowak", "Ulrich  Schmid"], "year": 2018, "n_citations": 2}

Model replication is a possible solution to this issue. It avoids biases associated with the language or toolkit used to develop the original model, not only promoting its verification and validation, but also fostering the credibility of the underlying conceptual model. However, different model implementations must be compared to assess their equivalence. The problem is, given two or more implementations of a stochastic model, how to prove that they display similar behavior? In this paper, we present a model comparison technique, which uses principal component analysis to convert simulation output into a set of linearly uncorrelated statistical measures, analyzable in a consistent, model-independent fashion. It is appropriate for ascertaining distributional equivalence of a model replication with its original implementation. Besides model-independence, this technique has three other desirable properties: a) it automatically selects output features that best explain implementation differences; b) it does not depend on the distributional properties of simulation output; and, c) it simplifies the modelers\u2019 work, as it can be used directly on simulation outputs.

Therefore a closer look at the impact of ICT in public financial management and performance is highly justified. Public finance is defined as a field of economics concerned with paying for collective or governmental activities, and with the administration and design of those activities. Activities will be viewed as services or more precisely as public services. We believe that there is need to consider performance from the perspective of effective performance and the perceived performance. In fact the real or effective performance might not correspond to the perceived performance. A service can be considered from the perspective of the decision-maker, who in our case could be a government or a collectivity. ICT can be employed in the three phases that concern the decision-maker: design, implementation and evaluation. The beneficiaries of a service can employ ICT in any of the three phases - awareness, exploitation and assessment - for guarantying a high level of efficiency. Each phase in the environment of a service will be presented as well as illustrations of how ICT can be employed in order to improve the end-result of each one of them. We believe that a high efficiency of each phase will produce a high global efficiency. It should be noted however that the effectiveness of any system is highly dependent on the human engagement in the system. Therefore, the impact of ICT in public financial management will be felt only if the decision-makers and the end-users of the services engage themselves in the success of the system. Instead of giving a catalog of services, the focus has been on the model (or methodology) to adopt in designing services for which ICT could enhance the implementation.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Amos  David"], "year": 2008, "n_citations": 2}

The key challenge for any engineer is therefore to develop process and products which ultimately lead towards total customer satisfaction. Recent development in technology has driven most of the IT industries to operate in the cloud environment due to reduced infrastructure investment and maintenance overheads. However, existing process in cloud lacks efficient multiple service paradigms that can provide improved business gain. Thus, it is the responsibility of every engineer to contribute towards effective and efficient techniques and models that can enhance the business performance. The position of this paper is to present several major issues prevailing in the IT industries such as delay time, response time, performance etc., which call for immediate attention in order to position themselves in the market. Further, this paper provides improved strategies through efficient job scheduling and modified resource allocation techniques for aforementioned issues in order to enhance the business performance in cloud-based IT sectors. The simulated results provided in this paper indicate the impact of enhanced solutions incorporated in the job processing strategies. They further enable better performance of the cloud with reduced delay and response time resulting towards improved throughput.

Furthermore, they have not suggested ways to identify suitable sites on a larger scale let alone means of surveying numerous micro-locations across the same building. Using a case study area focused on high-rise buildings in Singapore, this paper examines a novel application of 3D city models to identify suitable farming micro-locations in residential buildings. We specifically investigate whether the vertical spaces of these buildings comprising outdoor corridors, facades and windows receive sufficient photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) for growing food crops and do so at a high resolution. We also analyze the spatio-temporal characteristics of PAR, and the impact of shadows and different weather conditions on PAR in the building. Environmental simulations on the 3D model of the study area indicated that the cumulative daily PAR or Daily Light Integral (DLI) at a location in the building was dependent on its orientation and shape, sun's diurnal and annual motion, weather conditions, and shadowing effects of the building's facades and surrounding buildings. The DLI in the study area generally increased with building's levels and, depending on the particular micro-location, was found suitable for growing moderately light-demanding crops such as lettuce and sweet pepper. These variations in DLI at different locations of the same building affirmed the need for such simulations. The simulations were validated with field measurements of PAR, and correlation coefficients between them exceeded 0.5 in most cases thus, making a case that 3D city models offer a promising practical solution to identifying suitable farming locations in residential buildings, and have the potential for urban-scale applications.", "venue": "Comput.

The design is scalable: all species of DNA strands can in principle be mixed and prepared in a single test tube, rather than requiring separate purification of each species, which is a barrier to large-scale synthesis. The design is time-responsive: the concentration of output species changes in response to the concentration of input species, so that time-varying inputs may be continuously processed. The design is digital: Boolean values of wires in the circuit are represented as high or low concentrations of certain species, and we show how to construct a single-input, single-output signal restoration gate that amplifies the difference between high and low, which can be distributed to each wire in the circuit to overcome signal degradation. This means we can achieve a digital abstraction of the analog values of concentrations. Finally, the design is energy-efficient: if input species are specified ideally (meaning absolutely 0 concentration of unwanted species), then output species converge to their ideal concentrations at steady-state, and the system at steady-state is in (dynamic) equilibrium, meaning that no energy is consumed by irreversible reactions until the input again changes.", "venue": "DNA", "authors": ["Ehsan  Chiniforooshan", "David  Doty", "Lila  Kari", "Shinnosuke  Seki"], "year": 2010, "n_citations": 28}

However, this comes to a price. Business requirements always change. Likewise, IT systems constantly evolves as developers make new versions of them, which require endless administrative manual work to customize and configure them, especially if they are being used in different contexts, by different types of users, and for different requirements. Autonomic computing was conceived to provide an answer to these ever-changing requirements. Essentially, autonomic systems are self-configuring, self-healing, self-optimizing, and self-protecting; hence, they can automate all complex IT processes without human intervention. This paper proposes an autonomic model based on Venn diagram and set theory for self-configuring C#.NET applications, namely the self-customization of their GUI, event-handlers, and security permissions. The proposed model does not require altering the source-code of the original application; rather, it uses an XML-based customization file to turn on and off the internal attributes of the application. Experiments conducted on the proposed model, showed a successful automatic customization for C# applications and an effective self-adaption based on dynamic business requirements. As future work, other programming languages such as Java and C++ are to be supported, in addition to other operating systems such as Linux and Mac so as to provide a standard platform-independent autonomic self-configuring model.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Youssef  Bassil", "Paul  Semaan"], "year": 2012, "n_citations": 0}

At this abstraction level, a timed sequence ofpertinent \"events\" input to a system (or internal, in the case of timeouts) cause instantaneous changes to the state of the system. Between events, the state does not change, resulting in a a piecewise constant state trajectory. Main advantages of DEVS are its rigorous formal definition, and its support for modular composition. \nThis chapter introduces the Classic DEVS formalism in a bottom-up fashion, using a simple traffic light example. The syntax and operational semantics of Atomic (i.e., non-hierarchical) models are intruced first. The semantics of Coupled (hierarchical) models is then given by translation into Atomic DEVS models. As this formal \"flattening\" is not efficient, a modular abstract simulator which operates directly on the coupled model is also presented. This is the common basis for subsequent efficient implementations. We continue to actual applications of DEVS modelling and simulation, as seen in performance analysis for queueing systems. Finally, we present some of the shortcomings in the Classic DEVS formalism, and show solutions to them in the form of variants of the original formalism.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Yentl Van Tendeloo", "Hans  Vangheluwe"], "year": 2017, "n_citations": 5}

Peer-to-peer communities may offer an alternative to the feed-in tariff model by enabling prosumers to directly sell their solar energy to local consumers (possibly at a rate that is beneficial for both consumer and prosumer). The Quartierstrom project investigates a transactional energy system that manages the exchange and remuneration of electricity between consumers, prosumers and the local electric grid provider in the absence of intermediaries. This whitepaper describes the prototypical real-world system being implemented in the town of Walenstadt, Switzerland, with 37 participating households. The community members of this pilot project pay a reduced tariff for grid usage if the electricity produced by a prosumer is sold to another community member, which is located on the same voltage or grid level downstream a substation1. Such a tariff structure incentivizes local balancing, i.e. locally produced energy can be consumed locally whenever possible to avoid costs from higher grid levels. The blockchain is a novel technology suitable to log the produced and consumed units of energy within a community, making it possible to implement market places. In those marketplaces, both prosumers and consumers can indicate a price at which they are willing to sell / buy locally produced solar energy without the intermediation of a utility.

The problem of community detection is a twofold problem that consists of determining the number of communities and, at the same time, finding those communities.

Lett. A373 (2009) 2338\u20132342]. Also, in considering the questions, \"why random?\" and \"why pulses?\", we show that the random pulse based scheme provides the advantages of realizing multivalued deterministic logic. Pulse trains are realized by an element called orthogonator. We discuss two different types of orthogonators, parallel (intersection-based) and serial (demultiplexer-based) orthogonators. The last one can be slower but it makes sequential logic design straightforward. We propose generating a multidimensional logic hyperspace [Phys. Lett. A373 (2009) 1928\u20131934] by using the zero-crossing events of uncorrelated Gaussian electrical noises available in the chips. The spike trains in the hyperspace are non-overlapping, and are referred to as neuro-bits. To demonstrate this idea, we generate three-dimensional hyperspace bases using the zero-crossing events of two uncorrelated Gaussian noise sources. In such a scenario, the detection of different hyperspace basis elements may have vastly differing delays. We show that it is possible to provide an identical speed for the detection of all the hyperspace bases elements using correlated noise sources, and demonstrate this for the two neuro-bits situation. The key impact of this paper is to demonstrate that a logic design approach using such neuro-bits can yield a fast, low power and environmental variation tolerant means of designing computer circuitry. It also enables the realization of multivalued logic, and also significantly increasing the complexity of computer circuits by allowing several neuro-bits to be transmitted on a single wire.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Zoltan  Gingl", "Sunil P.

The idea is to construct a fully preemptive schedule that leads to minimum energy consumption when the tasks take on approximately the average execution cycles yet still guarantees no deadline violation during the worst-case scenario. End-time for each sub-instance of the tasks obtained from the schedule is used for the on-line dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) of the tasks. For the tasks that normally require a small number of cycles but occasionally a large number of cycles to complete, such a schedule provides more opportunities for slack utilization and hence results in larger energy saving. The concept is realized by formulating the problem as a nonlinear programming (NLP) optimization problem.

The effect of a computer intensive training process on overall accuracy of the method was found to be insignificant when the method was implemented with four or fewer neighbors. Overall, the accuracy of the analogy based method, while still significantly less accurate than manually working up estimates, might be worthwhile to implement in practice, depending labor costs in an adopting firm. A simulation model was used to compare manual versus analytical estimation methods.

The works of G\\\"odel, Turing and others showed that there are inherent limits and properties associated with the fact that language technology is enumerable. G\\\"odel's numbering technique is universal for enumerable structures and shows strong limits of the language technology. Computability theory is a particular example: programs can be numbered and all sorts of limits can be studied from there. Computability is also at the heart of science since any experimental validation of a theory supposes that theoretical results have been computed, then checked against concrete experiments. It implies that limitations on what is computable ultimately are also limits of what we understand as \"scientific theory\", and more generally to all the transmissible knowledge. We argue that it is fruitful to look a epistemology from a computability perspective. We show that it allows to precisely define different kinds of knowledge acquisition techniques, and helps the study of how they are related to one another.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Fr'ed'eric  Prost"], "year": 2020, "n_citations": 0}

These advantages have been recognised in the regulatory arena, especially for environmental risk assessment (ERA) of pesticides, where time-varying exposure is the norm. We critically evaluate the link between the modelled variables in TKTD models and the observations from laboratory ecotoxicity tests. For the endpoint reproduction, this link is far from trivial. The relevant TKTD models for sub-lethal effects are based on Dynamic-Energy Budget (DEB) theory, which specifies a continuous investment flux into reproduction. In contrast, experimental tests score egg or offspring release by the mother. The link between model and data is particularly troublesome when a species reproduces in discrete clutches, and even more so when eggs are incubated in the mother's brood pouch (and release of neonates is scored in the test). This situation is quite common among aquatic invertebrates (e.g., cladocerans, amphipods, mysids), including many popular test species. In this discussion paper, we treat these and other issues with reproduction data, reflect on their potential impact on DEB-TKTD analysis, and provide preliminary recommendations to correct them. Both modellers and users of model results need to be aware of these complications, as ignoring them could easily lead to unnecessary failure of DEB-TKTD models during calibration, or when validating them against independent data for other exposure scenarios.

This paper aims in modeling and to autonomously perform real-time load scheduling of dc platform supply vessel (PSV) with an objective to minimize specific fuel oil consumption (SFOC) for better fuel efficiency. Focus has been on the modeling of various components and control routines, which are envisaged to be an integral part of dc PSVs. Integration with photovoltaic-based energy storage system (ESS) has been considered as an option to cater for the short time load transients. In this context, this paper proposes a real-time transient simulation scheme, which comprises of optimized generation scheduling of generators and ESS using dc optimal power flow algorithm. This framework considers real dynamics of dc PSV during various marine operations with possible contingency scenarios, such as outage of generation systems, abrupt load changes, and unavailability of ESS. The proposed modeling and control routines with real-time transient simulation scheme have been validated utilizing the real-time marine simulation platform. The results indicate that the coordinated treatment of renewable-based ESS with DGs operating with optimized speed yields better fuel savings.

In this paper, we propose an efficient moment estimation method, called multiple-population moment estimation (MPME), that significantly improves estimation accuracy under small sample size. The key idea is to leverage the data collected under different corners/configurations to improve the accuracy of moment estimation at each individual corner/configuration. Mathematically, we employ the hierarchical Bayesian framework to exploit the underlying correlation in the data.

What appears to be a sufficient but not necessary condition for local trapping, oscillation in the probe average distance curve, is discussed in the context of the theory of gravitational \"resonant returns\" that gives rise to strikingly similar oscillatory curves. It is suggested that the theory may be applicable to CFO as an aid to understanding trapping and to developing effective mitigation techniques, possibly based on a concept of \"energy\" in CFO space.

In this application, promptly finding out the missing event is of paramount importance. However, the existing missing tag detection protocols cannot efficiently handle the presence of a large number of unexpected tags whose IDs are not known to the reader, which shackles the time efficiency. To deal with the problem of detecting missing tags in the presence of unexpected tags, this paper introduces a two-phase Bloom filter-based missing tag detection (BMTD) protocol. The proposed BMTD exploits Bloom filter in sequence to first deactivate the unexpected tags and then test the membership of the expected tags, thus dampening the interference from the unexpected tags and considerably reducing the detection time. Moreover, the theoretical analysis of the protocol parameters is performed to minimize the detection time of the proposed BMTD and achieve the required reliability simultaneously. In addition, we derive a critical threshold on the unexpected tag size for the execution of first phase in BMTD. Extensive experiments are then conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed BMTD. The results demonstrate that the proposed BMTD significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions.", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Communications", "authors": ["Jihong  Yu", "Lin  Chen", "Rongrong  Zhang", "Kehao  Wang"], "year": 2017, "n_citations": 30}

However, it reveals providing a valuable tool to train orthopaedic surgeons and help them to plan complex surgical procedures.\n\n\nPURPOSE\nThis work's objective was to assess educational efficiency of a path simulator under fluoroscopic guidance applied to sacroiliac joint percutaneous screw fixation.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nWe evaluated 23 surgeons' accuracy inserting a guide-wire in a human cadaver experiment, following a pre-established procedure. These medical trainees were defined in three prospective respects: novice or skilled; with or without theoretical knowledge; with or without surgical procedure familiarity. The screw insertion in the human cadaver was performed in two different settings: either without prior training for a first group (G1) or after simulator guidance in the second group (G2). Analysed criteria for each tested surgeon included the number of intraoperative X-rays taken in order to achieve the surgical procedure as well as an iatrogenic index reflecting the surgeon's ability to detect any hazardous trajectory at the time of performing said procedure.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAn average number of 13 X-rays was required for wire implantation by the G1 group. G2 group, assisted by the simulator use, required an average of 10 X-rays. A substantial difference was especially observed within the novice sub-group (N), with an average of 12.75 X-rays for the G1 category and an average of 8.5 X-rays for the G2 category. In the second sub-group of operators devoid of procedural knowledge (P-), a significant difference was found, since 12 X-rays appeared on average required in the G1 group versus six in the G2 group. Finally, within the sub-group of operators with technical knowledge (T+), a significant difference also was found since an average of 16 X-rays was required in the G1 versus an average 10.8 X-rays in the G2 group. As far as the iatrogenic index is concerned, we were unable to observe any significant difference between the groups.\n\n\nDISCUSSION\nDespite some methodological variations, we were able to demonstrate the simulator's efficiency in familiarizing the operator with the use of a 2D imaging system as a first step facilitating the procedure conduct in the real 3D patient environment. Novice surgeons (N) having a good lumbosacral joint anatomy knowledge although devoid of specific surgical technique knowledge were the ones who most benefited from this guiding tool. Analysis of the training data collected during simulator's use helps orientating the prospective surgeon toward possession of not yet acquired learning points. This educational program can easily be extended to any other percutaneous technique requiring fluoroscopic control guidance.\n\n\nLEVEL OF EVIDENCE\nLevel III prospective diagnostic study.", "venue": "Orthopaedics & traumatology, surgery & research : OTSR", "authors": ["J\u00e9r\u00f4me  Tonetti", "Lucile  Vadcard", "P.

In the field of Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM), performance evaluation can be conducted on real-world aggregate signals, provided by smart energy meters or artificial superpositions of individual load signals (i.e., denoised aggregates). It has long been suspected that testing on these denoised aggregates provides better evaluation results mainly due to the fact that the signal is less complex. Complexity in real-world aggregate signals increases with the number of unknown/untracked loads. Although this is a known performance reporting problem, an investigation into the actual performance gap between real and denoised testing is still pending. In this paper, we examine the performance gap between testing on real-world and denoised aggregates with the aim of bringing clarity into this matter. Starting with an assessment of noise levels in datasets, we find significant differences in test cases. We give broad insights into our evaluation setup comprising three load disaggregation algorithms, two of them relying on neural network architectures. The results presented in this paper, based on studies covering three scenarios with ascending noise levels, show a strong tendency towards load disaggregation algorithms providing significantly better performance on denoised aggregate signals.

The shift from conventional engineering to bio-inspired engineering needs bring the subject (or problem) of computability to a new level. Within the frame of computation, so far, the prevailing paradigm is still the Turing-Church thesis. In other words, conventional engineering is still ruled by the Church-Turing thesis (CTt). However, CES is ruled by CTt, too. Contrarily to the above, we shall argue here that biological computation demands a more careful thinking that leads us towards hypercomputation. Bio-inspired engineering and CES thereafter, must turn its regard toward biological computation. Thus, biological computation can and should be taken as the ground for engineering complex non-linear systems. Biological systems do compute in terms of hypercomputation, indeed. If so, then the focus is not algorithmic or computational complexity but computation-beyond-the-Church-Turing-barrier. We claim that we need a new computational theory that encompasses biological processes wherein the Turing-Church thesis is but a particular case.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Nelson Alfonso G\u00f3mez-Cruz", "Carlos Eduardo Maldonado"], "year": 2011, "n_citations": 0}

The proposed approach relies on an accurate definition of the image distortion which takes into account both the pixel value differences and a model of the human visual system and is amenable to highly efficient hardware realization. Experimental results show that the histogram equalization for backlight scaling method results in about 45% power saving with an effective distortion rate of 5% and 65% power saving for a 20% distortion rate.

This might nevertheless result in system failure, as these less critical tasks could be accessing data, the consistency of which should be preserved.

While many approaches have been proposed to perform risk analysis, there has been less focus on delivering the prescriptive and specific information that managers require to select cost-effective countermeasures. This paper proposes a generic approach to integrate the cost assessment into risk analysis to aid such decision making. The approach makes use of a risk model which has been annotated with potential countermeasures, estimates for their cost and effect.

Towards the development of a smart grid, utilities and governments across the world are encouraging smart meter deployments. High resolution (often at every 15 minutes) data from these smart meters can be used to understand and optimize energy consumptions in buildings. In addition to smart meters, buildings are also increasingly managed with Building Management Systems (BMS) which control different sub-systems such as lighting and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC). With the advent of these smart meters, increased usage of BMS and easy availability and widespread installation of ambient sensors, there is a deluge of building energy data. This data has been leveraged for a variety of applications such as demand response, appliance fault detection and optimizing HVAC schedules. Beyond the traditional use of such data sets, they can be put to effective use towards making buildings smarter and hence driving every possible bit of energy efficiency. Effective use of this data entails several critical areas from sensing to decision making and participatory involvement of occupants. Picking from wide literature in building energy efficiency, we identify five crust areas (also referred to as 5 Is) for realizing data driven energy efficiency in buildings : i) instrument optimally; ii) interconnect sub-systems; iii) inferred decision making; iv) involve occupants and v) intelligent operations. We classify prior work as per these 5 Is and dis-cuss challenges, opportunities and applications across them. Building upon these 5 Is we discuss a well studied problem in building energy efficiency -non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) and how research in this area spans across the 5 Is.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Nipun  Batra", "Amarjeet  Singh", "Pushpendra  Singh", "Haimonti  Dutta", "Venkatesh  Sarangan", "Mani B.

Therefore, there is the need to create test cases with which targeted hotspot patterns can be generated in routed layouts by using an APR (automatic placement and routing) tool. In this paper, we propose a methodology of creating hotspot patterns in the routing space by using Synopsys tools. Also, methods for repairing hotspots during the physical design phase are presented.

Those systems which cannot be modeled mathematically benefit most from a fuzzy control strategy since the imprecise data can he captured using linguistic variables in the rule-base. Fuzzy logic has certain disadvantages. The number of computations required for arriving at a certain output response for given inputs is very large and thus the system response is sluggish. Therefore to adapt fuzzy systems to real-time applications one needs to use faster algorithms and/or parallel processing. Also the process of defuzzification required to produce a single output value may lead to errors which can undo the advantages of fine control normally achievable using fuzzy logic. Special analytical techniques ensure that the complications of the defuzzification process are simplified; the method used retains the desirable features of fuzzy control.

In a bilateral communication, the acceptable round trip latency is usually in the order of 1ms up to 10ms depending on the application requirements. It is estimated that 70% of the total latency is generated by the communication network, and the remaining 30% is produced by master and slave devices. Thus, this paper aims to propose a strategy to reduce 30% of the total latency that is produced by such devices. The strategy is to apply reconfigurable computation using FPGAs to minimize the execution time of device-associated algorithms. With this in mind, this work presents a hardware reference model for modules that implement nonlinear positioning and force calculations as well as a tactile system formed by two robotic manipulators.

Power optimization is one of the major design goals that is witnessing such new challenges. The presence of interaction between the cyber and physical components of a CPS leads to dependence between the time delay of a computational task and the amount of workload in the next iteration. We demonstrate that it is essential to take this delay-workload dependence into consideration in order to achieve low power consumption. In this paper, we identify this new challenge, and present the first formal and comprehensive model to enable rigorous investigations on this topic. We propose a simple power management policy, and show that this policy achieves a best possible notion of optimality. In fact, we show that the optimal power consumption is attained in a \u201csteady-state\u201d operation and a simple policy of finding and entering this steady state suffices, which can be quite surprising considering the added complexity of this problem.

While a great effort has been made to modeling its control logic by assuming an ideal communication and positioning infrastructure, the architectural dimension and the influence of pedestrian positioning uncertainty have been largely overlooked. In our previous research, a cell-based crowd evacuation system (CellEVAC) was proposed that dynamically allocates exit gates to pedestrians in a cell-based pedestrian positioning infrastructure. This system provides optimal exit-choice indications through color-based indications and a control logic module built upon an optimized discrete-choice model. Here, we investigate how location-aware technologies and wearable devices can be used for a realistic deployment of CellEVAC. We consider a simulated real evacuation scenario (Madrid Arena) and propose a system architecture for CellEVAC that includes: a controller node, a radio-controlled light-emitting diode (LED) wristband subsystem, and a cell-node network equipped with active Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) devices. These subsystems coordinate to provide control, display, and positioning capabilities. We quantitatively study the sensitivity of evacuation time and safety to uncertainty in the positioning system. Results showed that CellEVAC was operational within a limited range of positioning uncertainty. Further analyses revealed that reprogramming the control logic module through a simulation optimization process, simulating the positioning system\u2019s expected uncertainty level, improved the CellEVAC performance in scenarios with poor positioning systems.", "venue": "Sensors", "authors": ["Miguel A.

These advantages have been recognised in the regulatory arena, especially for environmental risk assessment (ERA) of pesticides, where time-varying exposure is the norm. We critically evaluate the link between the modelled variables in TKTD models and the observations from laboratory ecotoxicity tests. For the endpoint reproduction, this link is far from trivial. The relevant TKTD models for sub-lethal effects are based on Dynamic-Energy Budget (DEB) theory, which specifies a continuous investment flux into reproduction. In contrast, experimental tests score egg or offspring release by the mother. The link between model and data is particularly troublesome when a species reproduces in discrete clutches, and even more so when eggs are incubated in the mother\u2019s brood pouch (and release of neonates is scored in the test). This situation is quite common among aquatic invertebrates (e.g., cladocerans, amphipods, mysids), including many popular test species. We discuss these and other issues with reproduction data, reflect on their potential impact on DEB-TKTD analysis, and provide preliminary recommendations to correct them.

Part II: Operations in an open comparative mode", "abstract": "This paper describes a new method, HGV2C, for pattern analysis. The HGV2C method involves the construction of a computer ego (CE) based on an individual object that can be either a part of the system under analysis or a newly created object based on a certain hypothesis. The CE provides a capability to analyze data from a specific standpoint, e.g. from a viewpoint of a certain object. The CE is constructed from two identical copies of a query object, and its functioning mechanism involves: a hypothesis-parameter (HP) and infothyristor (IT). HP is a parameter that is introduced into an existing set of parameters. The HP value for one of the clones of a query object is set to equal 1, whereas for another clone it is greater than 1. The IT is based on the previously described algorithm of iterative averaging and performs three functions: 1) computation of a similarity matrix for the group of three objects including two clones of a query object and a target object; 2) division of the group into two alternative subgroups; and 3) a successive increase of the HP weight in the totality of all the parameters. Initially, both clones of the query object appear together in one of the subgroups as all of their parameter values, except the HP, are identical. At a certain point of the HP multiplication, one of the clones moves to the group of the target object. A respective number of the HP multiplications represents the dissimilarity (D) between the query and target objects. The product of D multiplied by the difference in HP values of the clones is strictly constant and linearly increases as the difference in HP values of the clones decreases.

One of the goals of performing a HIL simulation at the European Proximity Operation Simulator (EPOS) is to simulate on-orbit servicing for verification and validation of the docking phase. The simulator essentially consists of two robots, with very accurate position controllers, holding a docking interface and a probe element, respectively. A key feature of the HIL docking simulator set-up is a feedback loop that is closed on the real force sensed at the docking interface during the contact with the probe, which is used in order to drive the free-floating bodies numerical \nsimulation. The high stiffness of the robots causes the contact duration to be shorter than the (incompressible) time delay in the robots' dynamics. This leads to inconsistencies in the HIL docking simulation results and to potential instability and damage of the closed-loop system. This work presents a novel mitigation strategy to the given challenge, accompanied \nwith stability analysis and validating experiments. The high-stiffness compliance issue is modified by combining virtual and real compliances in the software and hardware. The method is presented here for six degrees of freedom. Experimental results for the case of a translational motion along a single axis and the six degrees of freedom are presented, too. In addition, analysis is performed in order to characterize the stability region of the HIL docking simulator as a function of the contact force parameters, the time delay and the simulated satellites' masses. This hybrid contact dynamics model and the accompanying analysis is envisioned to provide a safe and flexible docking simulator tool.

It can raise citizen awareness of noise pollution levels, and aid in the development of mitigation strategies to cope with the adverse effects. However, state-of-the-art techniques for rendering noise maps in urban areas are expensive and rarely updated (for months or even years), as they rely on population and traffic models rather than on real data. Smart phone based urban sensing can be leveraged to create an open and inexpensive platform for rendering up-to-date noise maps. In this paper, we present the design, implementation and performance evaluation of an end-to-end, context-aware, noise mapping system called Ear-Phone. \n \nEar-Phone investigates the use of different interpolation and regularization methods to address the fundamental problem of recovering the noise map from incomplete and random samples obtained by crowdsourcing data collection. Ear-Phone, implemented on Nokia N95, N97 and HP iPAQ, HTC One mobile devices, also addresses the challenge of collecting accurate noise pollution readings at a mobile device. A major challenge of using smart phones as sensors is that even at the same location, the sensor reading may vary depending on the phone orientation and user context (for example, whether the user is carrying the phone in a bag or holding it in her hand). To address this problem, Ear-Phone leverages context-aware sensing. We develop classifiers to accurately determine the phone sensing context. Upon context discovery, Ear-Phone automatically decides whether to sense or not. Ear-Phone also implements in-situ calibration which performs simple calibration that can be carried out by general public. Extensive simulations and outdoor experiments demonstrate that Ear-Phone is a feasible platform to assess noise pollution, incurring reasonable system resource consumption at mobile devices and providing high reconstruction accuracy of the noise map.", "venue": "Pervasive Mob.

Thus, it does not need any extra signal processing modular to remove MA as in some other algorithms. Furthermore, seeking spectral peaks associated with heart rate is simplified.

CrowdInside leverages the smart phones sensors that are ubiquitously available with humans who use a building to automatically and transparently construct accurate motion traces. These accurate traces are generated based on a novel technique for reducing the errors in the inertial motion traces by using the points of interest in the indoor environment, such as elevators and stairs, for error resetting. The collected traces are then processed to detect the overall floorplan shape as well as higher level semantics such as detecting rooms and corridors shapes along with a variety of points of interest in the environment. Implementation of the system in two testbeds, using different Android phones, shows that CrowdInside can detect the points of interest accurately with 0.2% false positive rate and 1.3% false negative rate. In addition, the proposed error resetting technique leads to more than 12 times enhancement in the median distance error compared to the state-of-the-art. Moreover, the detailed floorplan can be accurately estimated with a relatively small number of traces. This number is amortized over the number of users of the building.

The main idea behind the present research work is to identify the maximum number of indistinguishable faults present in the given circuit and minimize the number of test cases based on the number of faults that has been detected. Heuristic approach is used for test minimization part, which identifies the essential tests from overall test cases. From the results it is observed that, test minimization varies from 50% to 99% with the lowest one corresponding to a circuit with four gates .Test minimization is low in case of circuits with lesser input leads in gates compared to greater input leads in gates for the boolean expression with same number of symbols. Achievement of 99% reduction is due to the fact that the large number of tests find the same faults. The new approach is implemented for simple circuits.

As a consequence, predicting which protein pairs interact is a fundamental problem. Experimental methods are slow, expensive, and may be error prone. Many computational methods have been proposed to identify candidate interacting pairs.

Results: We present, a new algorithm that leverages both topological and biological information to predict protein-protein interactions. We comprehensively compare our Framework with state-of-the-art approaches on reliable PPIs datasets, showing that they have competitive or higher accuracy on biologically validated test sets.

To this end, we first develop a platform to perform two important features required for study: a) a realistic fault injection into the SSD in the computing systems and b) data loss detection mechanism on the SSD upon power failure. In the proposed physical fault injection platform, SSDs experience a real discharge phase of Power Supply Unit (PSU) that occurs during power failure in data centers which was neglected in previous studies. The impact of workload dependent parameters such as workload Working Set Size (WSS), request size, request type, access pattern, and sequence of accesses on the failure of SSDs is carefully studied in the presence of realistic power failures. Experimental results over thousands number of fault injections show that data loss occurs even after completion of the request (up to 700ms) where the failure rate is influenced by the type, size, access pattern, and sequence of IO accesses while other parameters such as workload WSS has no impact on the failure of SSDs.", "venue": "2018 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition (DATE)", "authors": ["Saba  Ahmadian", "Farhad  Taheri", "Mehrshad  Lotfi", "Maryam  Karimi", "Hossein  Asadi"], "year": 2018, "n_citations": 13}

This algorithm borrows the concept of Cognitive Packet Network (CPN), which is a flexible protocol that can rapidly solve optimal solution for any user-defined goal function. Spatial information regarding the location and spread of hazards is taken into consideration to avoid that evacuees be directed towards hazardous zones. Furthermore, since previous emergency navigation algorithms are normally insensitive to sudden changes in the hazard environment such as abrupt congestion or injury of civilians, evacuees are dynamically assigned to several groups to adapt their course of action with regard to their on-going physical condition and environments. Simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm which is sensitive to the needs of evacuees produces better results than the use of a single metric.

Traditional ways for collecting travel-speed oriented traffic data always depend on dedicated sensors and supporting infrastructures, and are therefore financial costly. Differently, vehicular crowdsensing as an infrastructure-free way, can be used to collect data including real-time locations and velocities of vehicles for road travel speed estimation, which is a quite low-cost way. However, vehicular crowdsensing data is always coarse-grained. This coarseness can lead to the incompleteness of travel speeds. Aiming to handle this problem as well as estimate travel speed accurately, in this paper, we propose an approach named STC that exploits the spatial-temporal correlation among travel speeds for roads by introducing the time-lagged cross correlation function. The time lagging factor describes the time consumption of traffic feature diffusion along roads. To properly calculate cross correlation, we novelly make the determination of the time lagging factor self-adaptive by recording the locations of vehicles at different roads. Then, utilizing the local stationarity of cross correlation, we further reduce the problem of single-road travel speed vacancy completion to a minimization problem. Finally, we fill all the vacancies of travel speed for roads in a recursive way using the geometric structure of road net. Elaborate experiments based on real taxi trace data show that STC can settle the incompleteness problem of vehicle crowdsensing data based travel speed estimation and ensure the accuracy of estimated travel speed better, in comparison with representative existing methods such as KNN, Kriging and ARIMA.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Lu  Shao", "Cheng  Wang", "Changjun  Jiang"], "year": 2015, "n_citations": 1}

Here, we investigate drawing, the most basic form of visual communication. Participants were paired in an online environment to play a drawing-based reference game. On each trial, both participants were shown the same four objects, but in different locations. The sketcher\u2019s goal was to draw one of these objects so that the viewer could select it from the array. On \u201cclose\u201d trials, objects belonged to the same basic-level category, whereas on \u201cfar\u201d trials objects belonged to different categories. We found that people exploited shared information to efficiently communicate about the target object: on far trials, sketchers achieved high recognition accuracy while applying fewer strokes, using less ink, and spending less time on their drawings than on close trials. We hypothesized that humans succeed in this task by recruiting two core faculties: visual abstraction, the ability to perceive the correspondence between an object and a drawing of it; and pragmatic inference, the ability to judge what information would help a viewer distinguish the target from distractors. To evaluate this hypothesis, we developed a computational model of the sketcher that embodied both faculties, instantiated as a deep convolutional neural network nested within a probabilistic program. We found that this model fit human data well and outperformed lesioned variants.

Deflection was simulated using Coventorware ver.2005 software and verified with calculation results obtained using shell bending theory. Screening design was used to construct a systematic approach for selecting the best encapsulant material and thickness under uniform pressure up to 100\u00a0atm.

It was observed that PPS high modulus carbon fiber has deflection of less than 5\u00a0\u03bcm for all thickness and pressure variations. LCP carbon fiber is acceptable and SMC polyimide is unsuitable as high strength encapsulant. PPS high modulus carbon fiber is considered the best encapsulation material for MEMS under high-pressure packaging process due to its high strength.

One of the adaptive features of context-awareness is contextual reconfiguration. Contextual reconfiguration involves discovering remote service(s) based on context and binding them to the application components to realize new behaviors, which may be needed to satisfy user needs or to enrich user experience. One of the steps in the reconfiguration process involves a remote lookup to discover the service(s) based on context. This remote lookup process provides the largest contribution to reconfiguration time and this is due to fact that the remote calls are much slower than local calls. Consequently, it affects system performance. In pervasive computing applications, this may turn out to be undesirable in terms of user experience. Moreover, other distributed applications using the network may be affected as every remote method call decreases the amount of bandwidth available on the network. Various systems provide reconfiguration support and offer high-level reconfiguration directives to develop adaptive context-aware applications, but do not address this performance bottleneck. We address this issue and implement seamless caching of virtual stubs within our PCRA1 for improved performance.

Our study aims to introduce a preference relation into patterns and to discover the most preferred patterns under the constraint of statistical significance, which has never been considered in existing SSPM problems. We propose an iterative multiple testing procedure that can alternately reject a hypothesis and safely ignore the hypotheses that are less useful than the rejected hypothesis. One advantage of filtering out patterns with low utility is that it avoids consumption of the significance budget by rejection of useless (that is, uninteresting) patterns. This allows the significance budget to be focused on useful patterns, leading to more useful discoveries. We show that the proposed method can control the familywise error rate (FWER) under certain assumptions, that can be satisfied by a realistic problem class in SSPM. We also show that the proposed method always discovers a set of patterns that is at least equally or more useful than those discovered using the standard Tarone-Bonferroni method SSPM. Finally, we conducted several experiments with both synthetic and real-world data to evaluate the performance of our method.

Existing structural analysis methods need flattening of the hierarchical models into an equation system for analysis. However, the large-scale equations in complex models make structural analysis difficult. Aimed to address the issue, this study proposes a hierarchical structural analysis method by exploring the relationship between the singularities of the hierarchical equation-oriented model and its components. This method obtains the singularity of a hierarchical equation-oriented model by analyzing a dummy model constructed with the parts from the decomposing results of its components. Based on this, the structural singularity of a complex model can be obtained by layer-by-layer analysis according to their natural hierarchy. The hierarchical structural analysis method can reduce the equation scale in each analysis and achieve efficient structural analysis of very complex models. This method can be adaptively applied to nonlinear-algebraic and differential-algebraic equation models. The main algorithms, application cases and comparison with the existing methods are present in this paper. The complexity analysis results show the enhanced efficiency of the proposed method in the structural analysis of complex equation-oriented models.

The press abounds in examples illustrating these aspects, but one should draw not hasty and premature conclusions. The first successes in AI have been a surprise for society at large-including researchers in the field. Today, after the initial stupefaction, we have examples of the system reactions: traditional companies are heavily investing in AI, social platforms are monitored during elections, data collection is more and more regulated, etc. The resilience of an organization (i.e. its capacity to resist to a shock) relies deeply on the perception of its environment. Future problems have to be anticipated, while unforeseen events occurring have to be quickly identified in order to be mitigated as fast as possible. The author states that this clear perception starts with a common definition of AI in terms of capacities and limits. AI practitioners should make notions and concepts accessible to the general public and the impacted fields (e.g. industries, law, education). It is a truism that only law experts would have the potential to estimate IA impacts on judicial system. However, questions remain on how to connect different kind of expertise and what is the appropriate level of detail required for the knowledge exchanges. And the same consideration is true for dissemination towards society. Ultimately, society will live with decisions made by the \"experts\". It sounds wise to involve society in the decision process rather than risking to pay consequences later. Therefore, society also needs the key concepts to understand AI impact on their life.

Several variations of their curvatures and orientations generate difficulties during their manufacturing or the machining of dies used in moulding, injection and forging. Analysis of several parts highlights two levels of difficulties between three types of shapes: prismatic parts with simple geometrical shapes, aeronautic structure parts composed of several shallow pockets and forging dies composed of several deep cavities which often contain protrusions. This paper mainly concerns High Speed Machining (HSM) of these dies which represent the highest complexity level because of the shapes' geometry and their topology. Five axes HSM is generally required for such complex shaped parts but 3 axes machining can be sufficient for dies. Evolutions in HSM CAM software and machine tools lead to an important increase in time for machining preparation. Analysis stages of the CAD model particularly induce this time increase which is required for a wise choice of cutting tools and machining strategies. Assistance modules for prismatic parts machining features identification in CAD models are widely implemented in CAM software. In spite of the last CAM evolutions, these kinds of CAM modules are undeveloped for aeronautical structure parts and forging dies. Development of new CAM modules for the extraction of relevant machining areas as well as the definition of the topological relations between these areas must make it possible for the machining assistant to reduce the machining preparation time. In this paper, a model developed for the description of complex shape parts topology is presented. It is based on machining areas extracted for the construction of geometrical features starting from CAD models of the parts. As topology is described in order to assist machining assistant during machining process generation, the difficulties associated with tasks he carried out are analyzed at first. The topological model presented after is based on the basic geometrical features extracted. Topological relations which represent the framework of the model are defined between the basic geometrical features which are gathered afterwards in macro-features. Approach used for the identification of these macro-features is also presented in this paper. Detailed application on the construction of the topological model of forging dies is presented in the last part of the paper.", "venue": "Comput.

These concerns are more urgent requirements for software-reliant systems that also include AI components due to the uncertainty introduced by data elements. Moreover, systems employed by the public sector exhibit unique design time and runtime challenges due to the regulatory nature of the domains.

A demanding solution to this problem is redundant via insertion during post-routing optimization. It becomes very critical when a multi-layer routing solution already incurs a large number of vias. Very few global routers addressed unconstrained via minimization (UVM) problem, while using minimal pattern routing and layer assignment of nets. It also includes a recent floorplan based early global routability assessment tool STAIRoute \\cite{karb2}. \nThis work addresses an early version of unconstrained via minimization problem during early global routing by identifying a set of minimal bend routing regions in any floorplan, by a new recursive bipartitioning framework. These regions facilitate monotone pattern routing of a set of nets in the floorplan by STAIRoute. The area/number balanced floorplan bipartitionining is a multi-objective optimization problem and known to be NP-hard \\cite{majum2}. No existing approaches considered bend minimization as an objective and some of them incurred higher runtime overhead. In this paper, we present a Greedy as well as randomized neighbor search based staircase wave-front propagation methods for obtaining optimal bipartitioning results for minimal bend routing through multiple routing layers, for a balanced trade-off between routability, wirelength and congestion. \nExperiments were conducted on MCNC/GSRC floorplanning benchmarks for studying the variation of early via count obtained by STAIRoute for different values of the trade-off parameters ($\\gamma, \\beta$) in this multi-objective optimization problem, using $8$ metal layers.

We propose a 3D transrectal US based tracking system for precise prostate biopsy sample localisation. The aim is to improve sample distribution, to enable targeting of unsampled regions for repeated biopsies, and to make post-interventional quality controls possible. Since the patient is not immobilized, since the prostate is mobile and due to the fact that probe movements are only constrained by the rectum during biopsy acquisition, the tracking system must be able to estimate rigid transformations that are beyond the capture range of common image similarity measures. We propose a fast and robust multi-resolution attribute-vector registration approach that combines global and local optimization methods to solve this problem.

Network-on-chip (NoC) has been proposed as an efficient solution to handle this distinctive challenge. In this thesis, we have explored the high performance NoC design for MPSoC and CMP structures from the performance modeling in the offline design phase to the routing algorithm and NoC architecture optimization. More specifically, we first deal with the issue of how to estimate an NoC design fast and accurately in the synthesis inner loop. For this purpose, we propose a machine learning based latency regression model to evaluate the NoC designs with respect to different configurations. Then, for high performance NoC designs, we tackle one of the most important problems, i.e., the routing algorithms design. For avoiding temperature hotspots, a thermal-aware routing algorithm is proposed to achieve an even temperature profile for application-specific Network-on-chips (NoCs). For improving the reliability, a routing algorithm to achieve maximum performance under fault is proposed. Finally, in the architecture level, we propose two new NoC structures using bi-directional links for the performance optimization. In particular, we propose a flit-level speedup scheme to enhance the network-on-chip(NoC) performance utilizing bidirectional channels. We also propose a flexible NoC architecture which takes advantage of a dynamic distributed routing algorithm and improves the NoC communication performance with moderate energy overhead.

In this context, distributed generators (DGs) are exploited to achieve other objectives beyond supporting loads, such as the minimization of the power losses along the distribution lines. The aim of this work is that of designing a full-fledged system that extends existing state of the art algorithms for the distributed minimization of power losses. We take into account practical aspects such as the design of a communication and coordination protocol that is resilient to link failures and manages channel access, message delivery and DG coordination. Thus, we analyze the performance of the resulting optimization and communication scheme in terms of power loss reduction, reduction of aggregate power demand, convergence rate and resilience to communication link failures. After that, we discuss the results of a thorough simulation campaign, obtained using topologies generated through a statistical approach that has been validated in previous research, by also assessing the performance deviation with respect to localized schemes, where the DGs are operated independently. Our results reveal that the convergence and stability performance of the selected algorithms vary greatly. However, configurations exist for which convergence is possible within five to ten communication steps and, when just 30% of the nodes are DGs, the aggregate power demand is roughly halved. Also, some of the considered approaches are quite robust against link failures as they still provide gains with respect to the localized solutions for failure rates as high as 50%.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Riccardo  Bonetto", "Stefano  Tomasin", "Michele  Rossi"], "year": 2013, "n_citations": 2}

In such parts, tool paths generated for bottom machining feature with the conventional parallel plane strategy induced many feed rate reductions, especially when boundaries of the feature have a lot of curvatures and are not parallel. Several machining experiments on hardened material lead to the conclusion that a tool path implying stable cutting conditions might guarantee a better part surface integrity. To ensure this stability, the shape machined must be decomposed when conventional strategies are not suitable. In this paper, an experimental approach based on high-speed performance simulation is conducted on a master bottom machining feature in order to highlight the influence of the curvatures towards a suitable decomposition of machining area. The decomposition is achieved through the construction of intermediate curves between the closed boundaries of the feature. These intermediate curves are used as guidance curve for the tool paths generation with an alternative machining strategy called \u201cguidance curve strategy\u201d.

One of the important sources for scientific big data is the datasets collected by Internet of things (IoT). It's considered that these datesets contain highly useful and valuable information. For an IoT application to analyze big sensor data, it is necessary that the data are clean and lossless. However, due to unreliable wireless link or hardware failure in the nodes, data loss in IoT is very common. To reconstruct the missing big sensor data, firstly, we propose an algorithm based on matrix rank-minimization method. Then, we consider IoT with multiple types of sensor in each node. Accounting for possible correlations among multiple-attribute sensor data, we propose tensor-based methods to estimate missing values. Moreover, effective solutions are proposed using the alternating direction method of multipliers. Finally, we evaluate the approaches using two real sensor datasets with two missing data-patterns, i.e., random missing pattern and consecutive missing pattern. The experiments with real-world sensor data show the effectiveness of the proposed methods.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Yongshuai  Shao", "Zhe  Chen"], "year": 2017, "n_citations": 4}

Given the stochastic features of these elements, most modeling approaches rely on Monte Carlo simulation. The computational costs associated to the simulation approach force to treating mostly small-sized systems, i.e. with a limited number of lumped components of a given renewable technology (e.g. wind or solar, etc.) whose behavior is described by a binary state, working or failed. In this paper, we propose an analytical multi-state modeling approach for the reliability assessment of distributed generation (DG). The approach allows looking to a number of diverse energy generation technologies distributed on the system. Multiple states are used to describe the randomness in the generation units, due to the stochastic nature of the generation sources and of the mechanical degradation/failure behavior of the generation systems. The universal generating function (UGF) technique is used for the individual component multi-state modeling. A multiplication-type composition operator is introduced to combine the UGFs for the mechanical degradation and renewable generation source states into the UGF of the renewable generator power output. The overall multi-state DG system UGF is then constructed and classical reliability indices (e.g. loss of load expectation (LOLE), expected energy not supplied (EENS)) are computed from the DG system generation and load UGFs. An application of the model is shown on a DG system adapted from the IEEE 34 nodes distribution test feeder.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Yanfu  Li", "Enrico  Zio"], "year": 2012, "n_citations": 7}

OFDM is very effective in combating intersymbol interference and can achieve high data rate in frequency selective channel. For OFDM communication systems, the frequency offsets in mobile radio channels distort the orthogonality between subcarriers resulting in Inter Carrier Interference (ICI). ICI causes power leakage among subcarriers thus degrading the system performance. A wellknown problem of OFDM is its sensitivity to frequency offset between the transmitted and received carrier frequencies. There are two deleterious effects caused by frequency offset one is the reduction of signal amplitude in the output of the filters matched to each of the carriers and the second is introduction of ICI from the other carriers. This research work investigates three effective methods for combating the effects of ICI: ICI Self Cancellation (SC), Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation, and Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) method.

The application of building metadata simplifies the creation of digital representations and provides portable data analytics. Typical metadata standards such as Brick and Haystack are used to describe the data of the building system. Brick uses standard ontologies to create building metadata. However, neither Haystack nor Brick has provided definitions about the Variable Refrigerant Flow (VRF) system so far. For years, both Brick and Haystack working groups have been discussing how to describe VRF in their schema, mainly about the classification of VRF and the definitions of VRF units. There were no settled solutions for these problems. Meanwhile, the global VRF market is growing increasingly fast because of the energy efficiency and installation simplicity of the VRF system. It is needed to have the metadata to describe VRF units in buildings for data analysis and management.

Then, the model and the service framework were developed and applied for a building in China. The framework can serve portable energy analysis for different areas.

We use a linear approximation to the network flow equations and apply linear programming techniques that optimize the dispatching of generators and loads in order to eliminate the network overloads associated with a damaged system. We also provide a simple model for the operator's response to various contingency events that is not always optimal due to either failure of the state estimation system or due to the incorrect subjective assessment of the severity associated with these events. This further allows us to use a game theoretic framework for casting the optimization of the operator's response into the choice of the optimal strategy which minimizes the operating cost. We use a simple strategy space which is the degree of tolerance to line overloads and which is an automatic control (optimization) parameter that can be adjusted to trade off automatic load shed without propagating cascades versus reduced load shed and an increased risk of propagating cascades.

In the literature, various techniques have been proposed addressing the energy optimization problem. The goal of each technique is to maintain a balance between user comfort and energy requirements, such that the user can achieve the desired comfort level with the minimum amount of energy consumption. Researchers have addressed the issue with the help of different optimization algorithms and variations in the parameters to reduce energy consumption. To the best of our knowledge, this problem is not solved yet due to its challenging nature. The gaps in the literature are due to advancements in technology, the drawbacks of optimization algorithms, and the introduction of new optimization algorithms. Further, many newly proposed optimization algorithms have produced better accuracy on the benchmark instances but have not been applied yet for the optimization of energy consumption in smart homes. In this paper, we have carried out a detailed literature review of the techniques used for the optimization of energy consumption and scheduling in smart homes. Detailed discussion has been carried out on different factors contributing towards thermal comfort, visual comfort, and air quality comfort. We have also reviewed the fog and edge computing techniques used in smart homes.", "venue": "Inf.", "authors": ["Abdul Salam Shah", "Haidawati  Nasir", "Muhammad  Fayaz", "Adidah  Lajis", "Asadullah  Shah"], "year": 2019, "n_citations": 38}

The virtual reality concept is familiar to us from online worlds, but our world as a virtual reality is usually a subject for science fiction rather than science. Yet logically the world could be an information simulation running on a multi-dimensional space-time screen. Indeed, if the essence of the universe is information, matter, charge, energy and movement could be aspects of information, and the many conservation laws could be a single law of information conservation. If the universe were a virtual reality, its creation at the big bang would no longer be paradoxical, as every virtual system must be booted up. It is suggested that whether the world is an objective reality or a virtual reality is a matter for science to resolve. Modern information science can suggest how core physical properties like space, time, light, matter and movement could derive from information processing. Such an approach could reconcile relativity and quantum theories, with the former being how information processing creates space-time, and the latter how it creates energy and matter.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Brian  Whitworth"], "year": 2008, "n_citations": 27}

A typical blog may consist of texts, images, audios and videos etc. Most of the blogs work as personal online diaries, while others may focus on specific interest such as photographs (photoblog), art (artblog), travel (tourblog), IT (techblog) etc. Another type of blogging called microblogging is also very well known now-a-days which contains very short posts. Like the developed countries, the users of blogs are gradually increasing in the developing countries e.g. Bangladesh. Due to the nature of open access to all users, some people misuse it to spread fake news to achieve individual or political goals. Some of them also post vulgar materials that make an embarrass situation for other bloggers. Even, sometimes it indulges the reputation of the victim. The only way to overcome this problem is to bring all the posts under supervision of the blog moderator. But it totally contradicts with blogging concepts. In this paper, we have implemented an algorithm that would help to prevent the offensive entries from being posted. These entries would go through a supervision process to justify themselves as legal posts. From the analysis of the result, we have shown that this approach can eliminate the chaotic situations in blogosphere at a great extent. Our experiment shows that about 90% of offensive posts can be detected and stopped from being published using this approach.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Kamanashis  Biswas", "Md.

Using methods derived from algorithmic complexity theory, we propose robust computational definitions of open-ended evolution and the adaptability of computable dynamical systems. Within this framework, we show that decidability imposes absolute limits on the stable growth of complexity in computable dynamical systems. Conversely, systems that exhibit (strong) open-ended evolution must be undecidable, establishing undecidability as a requirement for such systems. Complexity is assessed in terms of three measures: sophistication, coarse sophistication, and busy beaver logical depth. These three complexity measures assign low complexity values to random (incompressible) objects. As time grows, the stated complexity measures allow for the existence of complex states during the evolution of a computable dynamical system. We show, however, that finding these states involves undecidable computations. We conjecture that for similar complexity measures that assign low complexity values, decidability imposes comparable limits on the stable growth of complexity, and that such behavior is necessary for nontrivial evolutionary systems. We show that the undecidability of adapted states imposes novel and unpredictable behavior on the individuals or populations being modeled. Such behavior is irreducible.

Our model utilizes simple first-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs) in all modes, resulting from considering transistors as ideal switches in a simple RC model of the gate.

However, such big data sets are not always available, necessitating specialized models that apply to relatively few observations. One important area of sport-science research that features small data sets is the study of energy recovery from exercise. In this area, models are typically fitted to data collected from exhaustive exercise test protocols, which athletes can perform only a few times. Recent findings highlight that established recovery models like W \u2032 balance (W \u2032 bal) models are too simple to adequately fit observed trends in the data. Therefore, we investigated a hydraulic model that requires the same few data points as W \u2032 bal models to be applied, but promises to predict recovery dynamics more accurately. To compare the hydraulic model to established W \u2032 bal models, we retrospectively applied them to a compilation of data from published studies. In total, one hydraulic model and three W \u2032 bal models were compared on data extracted from five studies. The hydraulic model outperformed established W \u2032 bal models on all defined metrics, even those that penalize models featuring higher numbers of parameters. These results incentivize further investigation of the hydraulic model as a new alternative to established performance models of energy recovery. Fabian C.

Cellular automata has been extensively used in modelling the crowd. In regular cellular automata models, each pedestrian occupies a single cell with the size of a pedestrian body. Since the space is divided into relatively large cells, the movements of pedestrians look like the movements of pieces on a chess board. Furthermore, all pedestrians have the same body size and speed. In this paper, a method called fine grid cellular automata is proposed in which smaller cells are used and pedestrian body may occupy several cells. The model allows the use of different body sizes, shapes and speeds for pedestrian. \nThe proposed model is used for simulating movements of pedestrians toward a target. A typical walkway scenario is used to test and evaluate the model. The movements of pedestrians are smoother because of the finer grain discretization of movements and the simulation results match empirical speed-density graphs with good accuracy.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Siamak  Sarmady", "Fazilah  Haron", "Abdullah Zawawi Talib"], "year": 2014, "n_citations": 14}

These sites are Ajaccio (41\u00b055'N and 8\u00b048'E, seaside), Bastia (42\u00b033'N, 9\u00b029'E, seaside) and Corte (42\u00b030'N, 9\u00b015'E average altitude of 486 meters). This lack of weather station makes difficult the predictability of PV power grid performance. This work intends to study a methodology which can predict global solar irradiation using data available from another location for daily and hourly horizon. In order to achieve this prediction, we have used Artificial Neural Network which is a popular artificial intelligence technique in the forecasting domain. A simulator has been obtained using data available for the station of Ajaccio that is the only station for which we have a lot of data: 16 years from 1972 to 1987. Then we have tested the efficiency of this simulator in two places with different geographical features: Corte, a mountainous region and Bastia, a coastal region. On daily horizon, the relocation has implied fewer errors than a \u201cnaive\u201d prediction method based on the persistence (RMSE=1468 Vs 1383Wh/m\u00b2 to Bastia and 1325 Vs 1213Wh/m\u00b2 to Corte). On hourly case, the results were still satisfactory, and widely better than persistence (RMSE=138.8 Vs 109.3 Wh/m\u00b2 to Bastia and 135.1 Vs 114.7 Wh/m\u00b2 to Corte). The last experiment was to evaluate the accuracy of our simulator on a PV power grid localized at 10 km from the station of Ajaccio.

Existing techniques of fault diagnosis are impractical under operational conditions due to their lengthy diagnostic test sequences. To circumvent this deficiency a model assisted bimodular redundant approach is introduced -providing continuous error detection, fault diagnosis to the module level, and a self-repair capability, by means of which the system is automatically reconfigured to bypass failures and restore operation until the defective modules can be replaced or repaired. The theoretical basis for the approach is presented and an algorithm is developed for generating an optimal sequence of diagnostic tests. Since the method was designed for applications in which down time is to be minimal and since the effectiveness of the approach is dependent on the efficiency of a Boolean model of the system, a procedure is developed for the simulation of synchronous digital systems which minimizes execution time, economizes on storage requirements, while maintaining programming convenience.", "venue": "CSC '73", "authors": ["R.

The license describing these use-conditions typically accompanies the content as its metadata. A resulting problem is that the license and the content can get separated and lose track of each other. The best metadata have two distinct qualities--they are created automatically without user intervention, and they are embedded within the data that they describe. If licenses are also created and transported this way, data will always have licenses, and the licenses will be readily examinable. When two or more datasets are combined, a new dataset, and with it a new license, are created. This new license is a function of the licenses of the component datasets and any additional conditions that the person combining the datasets might want to impose. Following the notion of a data-purpose algebra, we model this phenomenon by interpreting the transfer and conjunction of data as inducing an algebraic operation on the corresponding licenses. When a dataset passes from one source to the next its license is transformed in a deterministic way, and similarly when datasets are combined the associated licenses are combined in a non-trivial algebraic manner. Modern, computer-savvy, licensing regimes such as Creative Commons allow writing the license in a special kind of language called Creative Commons Rights Expression Language (ccREL). ccREL allows creating and embedding the license using RDFa utilizing XHTML. This is preferred over DRM which includes the rights in a binary file completely opaque to nearly all users. The colocation of metadata with human-visible XHTML makes the license more transparent.

Basically the principle of sub- threshold logics is operating MOSFET in sub-threshold region and using the leakage current in that region for switching action, there by drastically decreasing power. To reduce the power consumption of sub-threshold circuits further, a novel body biasing technique termed VTMOS is introduced .VTMOS approach is realized from DTMOS approach. Dynamic threshold MOS (DTMOS) circuits provide low leakage and high current drive, compared to CMOS circuits, operated at lower voltages. The VTMOS is based on operating the MOS devices with an appropriate substrate bias which varies with gate voltage, by connecting a positive bias voltage between gate and substrate for NMOS and negative bias voltage between gate and substrate for PMOS. With VTMOS, there is a considerable reduction in operating current and power dissipation, while the remaining characteristics are almost the same as those of DTMOS. Results of our investigations show that VTMOS circuits improves the power up to 50% when compared to CMOS and DTMOS circuits, in sub- threshold region.. The performance analysis and comparison of VTMOS, DTMOS and CMOS is made and test results of Power dissipation, Propagation delay and Power delay product are presented to justify the superiority of VTMOS logic over conventional sub-threshold logics using Hspice Tool.

It is often assumed that a calibration CIR, that is, a measurement from when no person is present, is easily subtracted from a newly captured CIR. We show this is often not the case. We propose modeling the difference between a current set of CIRs and a set of calibration CIRs as a hidden Markov model (HMM). Multiple experimental deployments are performed to collect CIR data and test the performance of this model and compare its performance to existing methods.

The state-of-health (SoH) of batteries quantifies their degradation, but mobile devices are unable to support its accurate estimation -- despite its importance -- due mainly to their limited hardware and dynamic usage patterns, causing various problems such as unexpected device shutoffs or even fire/explosion. To remedy this lack of support, we design, implement and evaluate V-Health, a low-cost user-level SoH estimation service for mobile devices based only on their battery voltage, which is commonly available on all commodity mobile devices. V-Health also enables four novel use-cases that improve mobile users' experience from different perspectives. The design of V-Health is inspired by our empirical finding that the relaxing voltages of a device battery fingerprint its SoH, and is steered by extensive measurements with 15 batteries used for various commodity mobile devices, such as Nexus 6P, Galaxy S3, iPhone 6 Plus, etc. These measurements consist of 13,377 battery discharging/charging/resting cycles and have been conducted over 72 months cumulatively. V-Health has been evaluated via both laboratory experiments and field tests over 4-6 months, showing <5% error in SoH estimation.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Liang  He", "Kang G.

In this paper, we propose an effective approach and roadmap to numerically gain planar periodic orbits of three-body systems with arbitrary masses by means of machine learning based on an artificial neural network (ANN) model. Given any a known periodic orbit as a starting point, this approach can provide more and more periodic orbits (of the same family name) with variable masses, while the mass domain having periodic orbits becomes larger and larger, and the ANN model becomes wiser and wiser. Finally we have an ANN model trained by means of all obtained periodic orbits of the same family, which provides a convenient way to give accurate enough predictions of periodic orbits with arbitrary masses for physicists and astronomers. It suggests that the high-performance computer and artificial intelligence (including machine learning) should be the key to gain periodic orbits of the famous three-body problem.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Shijun  Liao", "Xiaoming  Li", "Yu  Yang"], "year": 2021, "n_citations": 0}

The results showed that permanent indentation cavities could be formed at temperatures ranging from 25degC to 75degC, and the depth of cavities created was applied force, temperature and dwell time dependent.

A distinct property of our method is that it relies exclusively on Global Positioning System (GPS) logs of drivers. This setting is highly relevant in practice as these data can easily be acquired. \nRelying on positional data alone means that all derived features will be correlated, so we strive to find a single quantity that allows us to perform the driving style analysis. To this end we consider a robust variation of the so called jerk of a movement. We show that our feature choice outperforms other more commonly used jerk-based formulations and we discuss the handling of noisy, inconsistent, and incomplete data as this is a notorious problem when dealing with real-world GPS logs. \nOur solving strategy relies on an agglomerative hierarchical clustering combined with an L-term heuristic to determine the relevant number of clusters.

The sum-product model also includes as its special cases the conventional product model as well as the recently proposed sum model, and improves upon these by: a) being applicable in both global and local distance scales; b) being more plausible from physical point of view; c) providing better goodness-of-fit to log-normal distribution than either of these models.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Jari  Salo"], "year": 2007, "n_citations": 4}

This effect decreases the possibility of adsorption of analyte and ligand because the chemical reaction is faster than the diffusion.

A tensor product operator on a pair of Hilbert spaces is a maximally general bilinear operator into a target Hilbert space. By maximally general here, it is meant that every bilinear operator from the same pair of spaces to any Hilbert space factors into the composition of the tensor product operator with a uniquely determined linear mapping on the target space. There are multiple distinct tensor product operators of the same type. Distinctly different tensor product operators can be associated with different parts of a multipartite system and can be taken into account when combining states of the parts into a state of the whole. Separability of states, and locality of operators and observables is tensor product operator dependent. Specifically, the same state in the target state space can be inseparable with respect to one tensor product operator but separable with respect to another, and no tensor product operator is distinguished relative to the others. Since tensor product operators in multipartite systems are not usually specified, they are effectively determined by the specific choice of linear operators used to serve as unitary operations or as observables. The unitary operator used to construct a Bell state from a pair of |0\u3009\u2019s being highly tensor product operator-dependent is a prime example. The relationship between two tensor product operators of the same type is given by composition with a unitary operator. There is an equivalence between change of tensor product operator and change of basis in the target space of the tensor product operator. For any effect that can be achieved with a change of tensor product operator together with a unitary operator or a projective measurement, that effect can be achieved by a change of basis in the target space together with the operator, and conversely. Among the effects that can be achieved is the localization of some nonlocal operators as well as separability of inseparable states.

This framework provides the requirements to develop m-learning application that can be used to share academic and administrative information among people within the university campus. A prototype application has been developed to demonstrate the important functionality of the proposed system in simulated environment. This system is supposed to work both in bulk SMS and interactive SMS delivery mode. Here we have combined both Short Message Service (SMS) and Wireless Access Protocols (WAP) browsers. SMS is used for Short and in time information delivery and WAP is used for detailed information delivery like course content, training material, interactive evolution tests etc. The push model is used for sending personalized multicasting messages to a group of mobile users with a common profile thereby improving the effectiveness and usefulness of the cntent delivered. Again pull mechanism can be applied for sending information as SMS when requested by end user in interactive SMS delivery mode. The main strength of the system is that, the actual SMS delivery application can be hosted on a mobile device, which can operate even when the device is on move.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Moumita  Majumder", "Sumit  Dhar"], "year": 2010, "n_citations": 5}

These messages contain position, speed, heading, and other vital information that makes the vehicles aware of their surroundings. The drawback of exchanging periodic cooperative messages is that they generate significant channel load. Decentralized Congestion Control (DCC) algorithms have been proposed to minimize the channel load. However, while the rationale for periodic message exchange is to improve awareness , existing DCC algorithms do not use awareness as a metric for deciding when, at what power, and at what rate the periodic messages need to be sent in order to make sure all vehicles are informed. We propose an environment- and context-aware DCC algorithm combines power and rate control in order to improve cooperative awareness by adapting to both specific propagation environments ( e.g. , urban intersections, open highways, suburban roads) as well as application requirements ( e.g. , different target cooperative awareness range). Studying various operational conditions ( e.g. , speed, direction, and application requirement), ECPR adjusts the transmit power of the messages in order to reach the desired awareness ratio at the target distance while at the same time controlling the channel load using an adaptive rate control algorithm. By performing extensive simulations, including realistic propagation as well as environment modeling and realistic vehicle operational environments (varying demand on both awareness range and rate), we show that ECPR can increase awareness by 20% while keeping the channel load and interference at almost the same level. When permitted by the awareness requirements, ECPR can improve the average message rate by 18% compared to algorithms that perform rate adaptation only.", "venue": "Comput.

Human retinotopic mapping can be revealed by analyzing cortex functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals when the subject is under specific visual stimuli. Conventional methods process, smooth, and analyze the retinotopic mapping based on the parametrization of the (partial) cortical surface. However, the retinotopic maps generated by this approach frequently contradict neuropsychology results. To address this problem, we propose an integrated approach that parameterizes the cortical surface, such that the parametric coordinates linearly relates the visual coordinate. The proposed method helps the smoothing of noisy retinotopic maps and obtains neurophysiological insights in human vision systems. One key element of the approach is the Error-Tolerant Teichm\u00fcller Map, which uniforms the angle distortion and maximizes the alignments to self-contradicting landmarks. We validated our overall approach with synthetic and real retinotopic mapping datasets. The experimental results show the proposed approach is superior in accuracy and compatibility.

The result is a ``line-curve'' which is seen as the envelope of it's tangents. Usually this gives an unclear image and is at the heart of the ``over-plotting'' problem; a barrier in the effective use of Parallel Coordinates. This problem is overcome by a transformation which provides directly the ``point-curve'' representation of a curve. Earlier this was applied to conics and their generalizations. Here the representation, also called dual, is extended to all planar algebraic curves. Specifically, it is shown that the dual of an algebraic curve of degree $n$ is an algebraic of degree at most $n(n - 1)$ in the absence of singular points. The result that conics map into conics follows as an easy special case. An algorithm, based on algebraic geometry using resultants and homogeneous polynomials, is obtained which constructs the dual image of the curve. This approach has potential generalizations to multi-dimensional algebraic surfaces and their approximation.

APNs are similar to Stochastic Petri Nets (SPNs) in as much as they both rely on component-based representation of system state space, in contrast to Markov chains that explicitly model the states of an entire system. In both frameworks, so-called tokens (denoted as small circles) represent individual entities comprising the system; however, SPN graphs contain two distinct types of nodes (called places and transitions) with transitions serving the purpose of routing tokens among places. As a result, a pair of place nodes in SPNs can be linked to each other only via a transient stop, a transition node. In contrast, APN graphs link place nodes directly by arcs (transitions), similar to state space diagrams for Markov chains, and separate transition nodes are not needed. Tokens in APN are distinct and have labels that can assume both discrete values (\u201ccolors\u201d) and continuous values (\u201cages\u201d), both of which can change during simulation. Component interactions are modeled in APNs using triggers, which are either inhibitors or enablers (the inhibitors\u2019 opposites). Hierarchical construction of APNs rely on using stacks (layers) of submodels with automatically matching color policies. As a result, APNs provide at least the same modeling power as SPNs, but, as demonstrated by means of several examples, the resulting models are often more compact and transparent, therefore facilitating more efficient performance evaluation of complex systems. 1 Background The paper introduces Abridged Petri Nets (APNs), a new graphical framework for modeling the stochastic behavior of complex systems that consist of multiple interacting components. This framework can be considered as a derivative of Stochastic Petri Nets (SPNs) [2] that aims at retaining SPNs versatility in terms of modeling power, while streamlining the choice of the modeling building blocks. The visual clutter and often confusing choices that are often perceived as the major obstacle to the larger success of SPNs are reduced [1], resulting in simpler and more transparent models that can be built using only graphical interface.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Vitali  Volovoi"], "year": 2013, "n_citations": 8}

The current approach to evaluation relies primarily on 1) testing AVs on public roads or 2) track testing with scenarios defined in a test matrix. These two methods have completely opposing drawbacks: the former, while offering realistic scenarios, takes too much time to execute and the latter, though it can be completed in a short amount of time, has no clear correlation to safety benefits in the real world. To avoid the aforementioned problems, we propose accelerated evaluation, focusing on the car-following scenario. The stochastic human-controlled vehicle (HV) motions are modeled based on 1.3 million miles of naturalistic driving data collected by the University of Michigan Safety Pilot Model Deployment Program. The statistics of the HV behaviors are then modified to generate more intense interactions between HVs and AVs to accelerate the evaluation procedure. The importance sampling theory was used to ensure that the safety benefits of AVs are accurately assessed under accelerated tests. Crash, injury and conflict rates for a simulated AV are simulated to demonstrate the proposed approach. Results show that test duration is reduced by a factor of 300 to 100 000 compared with the non-accelerated (naturalistic) evaluation. In other words, the proposed techniques have great potential for accelerating the AV evaluation process.", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems", "authors": ["Ding  Zhao", "Xianan  Huang", "Huei  Peng", "Henry  Lam", "David J.

In this paper, we propose a new low power coding technique by decreasing the number of switching activities on the buses which use transition signaling to transmit data. This approach dedicates the symbols with less ones to high probability data. MFLP unlike the most low power encoding does not rely on spatial redundancy. Due to this superiority, MFLP is unique in power decreasing in the Network on Chip (NoC). Not only does this algorithm reduce the power consumption, but also it can compress the data. It offers a tradeoff to designers to choose between compression and power; that is, the more power consumption decrease we need, the less compression we earn. This coding uses tree based infrastructure in order to decrease the number of ones to reduce the switching activities, and the power consumption consequently. The proposed algorithm constructs the tree with this contribution that code words with less ones are allocated to more frequent data.

However, due to the serious distortion of the received signal caused by the channel, this scheme suffers from a high Bit Error Rate (BER) under the condition of the low Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR). To solve this problem, we proposes a Carrier Waveform Inter-Displacement (CWID) modulation method based on the Linear Frequency Modulation (LFM) PSK and PTRM scheme. The new communication scheme reduces BER by increasing the difference from the carrier waveform for different symbols. Simulation results show the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Hai-Peng  Ren", "Yang  Zhao"], "year": 2013, "n_citations": 1}

Preliminary results", "abstract": "Prostate brachytherapy involves implanting radioactive seeds (I125 for instance) permanently in the gland for the treatment of localized prostate cancers, e.g., cT1c-T2a N0 M0 with good prognostic factors. Treatment planning and seed implanting are most often based on the intensive use of transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) imaging. This is not easy because prostate visualization is difficult in this imaging modality particularly as regards the apex of the gland and from an intra- and interobserver variability standpoint. Radioactive seeds are implanted inside open interventional MR machines in some centers. Since MRI was shown to be sensitive and specific for prostate imaging whilst open MR is prohibitive for most centers and makes surgical procedures very complex, this work suggests bringing the MR virtually in the operating room with MRI/TRUS data fusion. This involves providing the physician with bi-modality images (TRUS plus MRI) intended to improve treatment planning from the data registration stage. The paper describes the method developed and implemented in the PROCUR system. Results are reported for a phantom and first series of patients.

To obtain a potential diagnosis from a raw MCC/IMS measurement, several computational steps are necessary, which so far have required manual interaction, e.g., human evaluation of discovered peaks. We have recently proposed an automated pipeline for this task that does not require human intervention during the analysis. Nevertheless, there is a need for improved methods for each computational step. In comparison to gas chromatography / mass spectrometry (GC/MS) data, MCC/IMS data is easier and less expensive to obtain, but peaks are more diffuse and there is a higher noise level. MCC/IMS measurements can be described as samples of mixture models (i.e., of convex combinations) of two-dimensional probability distributions. So we use the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to deconvolute mixtures in order to develop methods that improve data processing in three computational steps: denoising, baseline correction and peak clustering. A common theme of these methods is that mixture components within one model are not homogeneous (e.g., all Gaussian), but of different types.

However, lossy compressor developers and users are missing a tool to explore the features of scientific data sets and understand the data alteration after compression in a systematic and reliable way. To address this gap, we have designed and implemented a generic framework called Z-checker. On the one hand, Z-checker combines a battery of data analysis components for data compression. On the other hand, Z-checker is implemented as an open-source community tool to which users and developers can contribute and add new analysis components based on their additional analysis demands. In this article, we present a survey of existing lossy compressors. Then, we describe the design framework of Z-checker, in which we integrated evaluation metrics proposed in prior work as well as other analysis tools. Specifically, for lossy compressor developers, Z-checker can be used to characterize critical properties (such as entropy, distribution, power spectrum, principal component analysis, and autocorrelation) of any data set to improve compression strategies. For lossy compression users, Z-checker can detect the compression quality (compression ratio and bit rate) and provide various global distortion analysis comparing the original data with the decompressed data (peak signal-to-noise ratio, normalized mean squared error, rate\u2013distortion, rate-compression error, spectral, distribution, and derivatives) and statistical analysis of the compression error (maximum, minimum, and average error; autocorrelation; and distribution of errors). Z-checker can perform the analysis with either coarse granularity (throughout the whole data set) or fine granularity (by user-defined blocks), such that the users and developers can select the best fit, adaptive compressors for different parts of the data set.

For instance, in testing refrigeration compressors, we want to find the true refrigeration capacity of the compressor being tested. Such test (also called an episode) may take up to four hours, being an actual hindrance to applying it to the total number of compressors produced. This work seeks to reduce the time spent on such industrial trials by employing Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) as dynamical models for detecting when a test is entering the so-called steady-state region. Specifically, we use Reservoir Computing (RC) networks which simplify the learning of RNNs by speeding up training time and showing convergence to a global optimum. Also, this work proposes a self-organized subspace projection method for RC networks which uses information from the beginning of the episode to define a cluster to which the episode belongs to. This assigned cluster defines a particular binary input that shifts the operating point of the reservoir to a subspace of trajectories for the duration of the episode. This new method is shown to turn the RC model robust in performance with respect to varying combination of reservoir parameters, such as spectral radius and leak rate, when compared to a standard RC network.", "venue": "Neurocomputing", "authors": ["Eric A.

One of the major challenges associated with wireless sensor networks is the quality of the data and more specifically the detection of segment outliers and unusual events. Most previous research has focused on detecting outliers that are errors that are caused by unreliable sensors and sensor nodes. However, there is an urgent need for the development of new tools capable of identifying, tagging and visualizing erroneous segment outliers and unusual events from sensor data streams. In this paper, we present a SOUE Detector (Segment Outlier and Unusual Event-Detector) system for wireless sensor networks that combines statistical analyses using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) with domain expert knowledge (captured via an ontology and semantic inferencing rules). The resulting Web portal enables scientist to efficiently search across a collection of wireless sensor data streams and identify, retrieve and display segment outliers (both erroneous and genuine) within the data streams. In this paper, we firstly describe the detection algorithms, the implementation details and the functionality of the SOUE Detector system. Secondly we evaluate our approach using data that comprises sensor observations collected from a sensor network deployed in the Springbrook National Park in Queensland, Australia.

Three different patterns of traffic flow towards the intersection have been tested. The system requires less waiting time, compared to the other models, including the random case where the flow is unpredictable.

Certain kinds of disturbance signals do not show distinct abrupt changes in the signal parameters. In those cases, the standard mother wavelets fail to achieve correct event-specific segmentations. A new adjustment technique to the standard Haar wavelet is proposed in this paper, by introducing 2n adjusting zeros in the Haar wavelet scaling filter, n being a positive integer.

Therefore, in the selection or construction of a suitable Schmitt-Trigger implementation, it is a necessity to accurately determine the metastable behavior. Only then one is able to compare different designs and thus guide proper optimizations, and only then one can assess the potential for residual metastable upsets. However, while the state of the art provides a lot of research and practical characterization approaches for flip-flops, comparatively little is known about Schmitt-Trigger characterization. Unlike the flip-flop with its single metastable point, the Schmitt-Trigger exhibits a whole range of metastable points depending on the input voltage. Thus the task of characterization gets much more challenging. In this paper we present different approaches to determine the metastable behavior of Schmitt-Triggers using novel methods and mechanisms.

Micro inkjetting was realized by using an inkjetting printer that ejects ink droplets from a printhead. This printhead consists of a glass nozzle with a diameter of 50 mum and a piezoelectric transducer that is coated on the nozzle. The silver colloidal solution was inkjetted on a sintered CT800 ceramic substrate, followed by curing at 200degC for 60 minutes. As a result, the silver trace with a thickness of 200 nm was obtained. The substrate, with the ejected silver thin film as the seed layer, was then immersed into a preinitiator solution to coat a layer of palladium for enhancing the deposition of nickel. Electroless nickel plating was successfully conducted at a rate of 0.39 mum /min, and the thickness of traces was plated up to 84 mum. This study demonstrates that the integration of inkjetting with plating is an effective method to form high aspect patterns at the demand location.", "venue": "2008 Symposium on Design, Test, Integration and Packaging of MEMS/MOEMS", "authors": ["P.

This study proposes a localization method that can avoid the occurrence of flip ambiguities in bounded distance measurement errors and constrained flying motions; to demonstrate its efficacy, the method is implemented on bilateration and trilateration. For bilateration, an improved bi-boundary model based on the unit disk graph model is created to compensate for the shortage of distance constraints, and two boundaries are estimated as the communication range constraint. The characteristic of the intersections of the communication range and distance constraints is studied to present a unique localization criterion which can avoid the occurrence of flip ambiguities. Similarly, for trilateration, another unique localization criterion for avoiding flip ambiguities is proposed according to the characteristic of the intersections of three distance constraints. The theoretical proof shows that these proposed criteria are correct. A localization algorithm is constructed based on these two criteria. The algorithm is validated using simulations for different scenarios and parameters, and the proposed method is shown to provide excellent localization performance in terms of average estimated error.

From the point of view of analog computability, the existence of an effective way to obtain solutions of these systems is essential. A pioneering model of analog computation is the General Purpose Analog Computer (GPAC), introduced by Shannon as a model of the Differential Analyzer and improved by Pour-El, Lipshitz and Rubel, Costa and Gra\\c{c}a and others. Its power is known to be characterized by the class of differentially algebraic functions, which includes the solutions of initial value problems for ordinary differential equations. We address one of the limitations of this model, concerning the notion of approximability, a desirable property in computation over continuous spaces that is however absent in the GPAC. In particular, the Shannon GPAC cannot be used to generate non-differentially algebraic functions which can be approximately computed in other models of computation. We extend the class of data types using networks with channels which carry information on a general complete metric space $\\xcal$; for example $\\xcal=C(\\rbb,\\rbb)$, the class of continuous functions of one real (spatial) variable. We consider the original modules in Shannon's construction (constants, adders, multipliers, integrators) and we add \\emph{(continuous or discrete) limit} modules which have one input and one output. We then define an L-GPAC to be a network built with $\\xcal$-stream channels and the above-mentioned modules. This leads us to a framework in which the specifications of such analog systems are given by fixed points of certain operators on continuous data streams. We study these analog systems and their associated operators, and show how some classically non-generable functions, such as the gamma function and the Riemann zeta function, can be captured with the L-GPAC.", "venue": "Log.

The proposed technique enables voltage tuning based on the observed frequency of the ROs, taken as a representation of the device speed and used to estimate a safe minimum operating voltage at a given core frequency. A conservative linear relationship between RO frequency and silicon speed is used to approximate the critical path of the processor. Using a multi-purpose RO not specically implemented for critical path characterisation is a unique approach to voltage tuning. The parameters governing the relationship between RO and silicon speed are obtained through the testing of a sample of processors from dierent wafer regions. These parameters can then be used on all devices of that model. The tuning method and software control framework is demonstrated on a sample of XMOS XS1-U8A-64 embedded microprocessors, yielding a dynamic power saving of up to 25% with no performance reduction and no negative impact on the real-time constraints of the embedded software running on the processor.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Steve  Kerrison", "Kerstin  Eder"], "year": 2015, "n_citations": 1}

Integration of accurate, reliable, and straightforward approaches that measure uncertainty of inspection processes are instrumental for the successful implementation of automated, data-driven quality management systems.

Using these accurate and reliable inputs, this research further develops novel, analytically-based approaches to improve the practical function of traditional construction fabrication quality management systems. Multiple descriptive and predictive analytical functionalities are developed to support and augment quality-associated decision-making processes. Multi-relational databases (e.g., quality management system, engineering design system, and cost management system) from an industrial company in Edmonton, Canada, are investigated and mapped to implement the novel system proposed. This research has contributed to academic literature and practice by: (1) advancing decision-support systems for construction management by developing a dynamic simulation environment that uses real-time data to enhance simulation predictability; (2) developing integrated analytical methods for improved modeling in fabrication quality-associated decision making; and (3) creating reliable and interpretable decision-support metrics for quality performance measurement, complexity analysis, and rework cost management to reduce the data interpretation load of practitioners and to uncover valuable knowledge and information from available data sources.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Wenying  Ji"], "year": 2019, "n_citations": 1}

We address this task by means of adaptive neural networks, which re-adjust their weights when transferred to new conditions. Such an adaptive account for computational models is typical of the field of developmental robotics, which investigates learning of motor control in artificial systems inspired on infants development. Similarly to robots, greenhouses are complex systems comprising technical and biological elements, whose state can be measured and modified through control actions. We present an adaptive model architecture to perform online learning on greenhouse models. This learning process makes use of an episodic memory and of online re-training. This allows for adaptation without the need for a complete new training, which might be prohibitive if the data under the new conditions is scarce. Current experiments focus on how a model of tomato photosynthesis, developed in a research facility, can adapt itself to a new environment in a production greenhouse. Further research will focus on model plasticity by means of adaptive learning rates and management of the episodic memory described in this paper. The models presented as a proof-of-concept estimate the transpiration and photosynthesis of a hydroponic tomato crop by using measurements of the climate as inputs. The models are trained and tested using data from a greenhouse in Berlin, Germany. Thereafter, the adaptive architecture is fed with data from a production greenhouse in southern Germany, where other tomato varieties were grown under different irrigation and climate strategies.

In other words, semantic similarity of every two adjacent nodes is unequal in these trees. It deteriorates the performance of contexts similarity computation. We overcome this limitation by weighting tree edges based on their semantic similarity. Weight of each edge is computed using Normalized Similarity Score (NSS) method. This method is based on frequencies of concepts (words) co-occurrences in the pages indexed by search engines.

Here we consider a special case wideband signal where two or more delayed copies of the same signal are transmitted over the same frequency and bandwidth, with the result that ISM dispersion and scattering cancel out during the detection stage. Such a signal is both a good beacon (easy to find) and carries arbitrarily large information rate (limited only by the atmospheric transparency to about 10 GHz). The discovery process uses an autocorrelation algorithm, and we outline a compute scheme where the beacon discovery search can be accomplished with only 2x the processing of a conventional sine wave search, and discuss signal to background response for sighting the beacon. Once the beacon is discovered, the focus turns to information extraction.

From the numerical results the mixing indices and mixing patterns demonstrated that the mixing ability of the SNR mu-reactor was much superior to that of the SGM. From a mixing test with phenolphthalein and sodium hydroxide solutions, the mixing lengths of the SNR mu-reactor were less than 4 mm for a Reynolds number over a wide range (Re = 0.1 - 10). From a comparison of mixing lengths, the results revealed also that the SNR mu-reactor surpassed the SGM in mixing performance by more than 200%.

This technology achieves radio frequency (RF) curing of adhesives used in microelectronics, optoelectronics and medical devices with potential simultaneous micron-scale alignment accuracy and bonding of devices. In principle, the open oven cavity can be fitted directly onto a flip-chip or wafer scale bonder and, as such, will allow for the bonding of devices through localised heating thus reducing the risk to thermally sensitive devices. Variable frequency microwave (VFM) heating and curing of an idealised polymer load is numerically simulated using a multi-physics approach. Electro-magnetic fields within a novel open ended microwave oven developed for use in micro-electronics manufacturing applications are solved using a dedicated Yee scheme finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) solver. Temperature distribution, degree of cure and thermal stresses are analysed using an Unstructured Finite Volume method (UFVM) multi-physics package. The polymer load was meshed for thermophysical analysis, whilst the microwave cavity - encompassing the polymer load - was meshed for microwave irradiation. The two solution domains are linked using a cross mapping routine. The principle of heating using the evanescent fringing fields within the open-end of the cavity is demonstrated.

Prominent examples of such models are based on pure delay channels (P), inertial delay channels (I), or the elaborate Delay Degradation Model (DDM) channels proposed by Bellido-Diaz et\u00a0al. We accomplish our goal by considering the border between solvability and non-solvability of a simple problem called short-pulse filtration (SPF), which is closely related to arbitration and synchronization. On one hand, we prove that SPF is solvable in bounded time in any such model that provides channels with non constant delay, like I and DDM. This is in opposition to the impossibility of solving bounded SPF in real (physical) circuit models. On the other hand, for binary circuit models with constant-delay channels, we prove that SPF cannot be solved even in unbounded time; again in opposition to physical circuit models. Consequently, indeed none of the binary value-domain models proposed so far (and that we are aware of) faithfully captures glitch propagation of real circuits.

It facilitates the creation of a scalable digital twin with different levels of modelling abstraction as well as giving GALS formalism for execution strategy. Furthermore, TiLA provides facilities to develop applications around the twin as well as an interface to synchronise the twin with the physical system through an industrial communication protocol.

Most of the ECG analysing systems use explicit time plane features for cardiac pattern classification. Application of this proposed technique for classification eliminates the need for extraction of various explicit time plane features and hence reduces the complexity of the system. The cross-correlation is the measure of similarity between two waveforms or two time series and the cross examination reveals localized similarities in time and scale. Parameters extracted from Wavelet Cross Spectrum (WCS) and Wavelet Coherence (WCOH) is used for classification. A pathologically varying pattern in QT zone of inferior lead III shows the presence of Inferior Myocardial Infarction (IMI). The Cross Wavelet Transform and Wavelet Coherence is used for the cross examination of single normal and abnormal (IMI) beats. A normal template beat is selected as the absolute normal pattern. Computation of the WCS and WCOH of the selected normal template and various other normal and abnormal beats reveals the existence of variation among patterns under study. The Wavelet cross spectrum and Wavelet coherence of various ECG patterns shows distinguishing characteristics over two specific regions R1 and R2, where R1 is the QRS complex location and R2 is the T wave region. Parameters are identified for classification of Type 1 IMI (non Q type, with ST elevation and attenuated QRS complex) and Type 2 IMI (Q type MI with deep Q and inverted T) and normal subjects.

Hence, casualties caused by the poor decisions and guidance are only apparent at the end of the evacuation process and cannot then be remedied. Previous research shows that the performance of routing algorithms for evacuation purposes are sensitive to the initial distribution of evacuees, the occupancy levels, the type of disaster and its as well its locations. Thus an algorithm that performs well in one scenario may achieve bad results in another scenario. This problem is especially serious in heuristic-based routing algorithms for evacuees where results are affected by the choice of certain parameters. Therefore, this paper proposes a simulation-based evacuee routing algorithm that optimises evacuation by making use of the high computational power of cloud servers. Rather than guiding evacuees with a predetermined routing algorithm, a robust Cognitive Packet Network based algorithm is first evaluated via a cloud-based simulator in a faster-than-real-time manner, and any \u201csimulated casualties\u201d are then re-routed using a variant of Dijkstra's algorithm to obtain new safe paths for them to exits.

To this end, we develop an empirical model that can be used in Monte Carlo simulations to study the dynamics of the underlying problem. Our model's parameters are derived from a unique data set provided by a large food bank and food rescue organization in north central Colorado. We find that food supply is a non-parametric heavy-tailed process that is well-modeled with an extreme value peaks-over-threshold model. Although the underlying process is stochastic, the basic approach of food rescue and redistribution appears to be feasible both at small and large scales. The ultimate efficacy of this model is intimately tied to the rate at which food expires and hence the ability to preserve and quickly transport and redistribute food. The cost of the redistribution is tied to the number and density of participating suppliers, and costs can be reduced (and supply increased) simply by recruiting additional donors to participate. Our results show that with sufficient funding and manpower, a significant amount of food can be rescued from the waste stream and used to feed the hungry.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Caleb T.

We then pay close attention to various types of NOMA candidates, including power-domain NOMA, code-domain NOMA, and NOMA multiplexing in multiple domains.

Although several researchers have proposed models for simulating urban growth, they have been primarily dependent on various manually selected spatial and nonspatial explanatory features for building models. A practical difficulty with this approach is manual selection procedure, which tends to make model design process laborious and non-generic. Despite the fact that explanatory features provide us with the understanding of a complex process, there has been no standard set of features in urban growth prediction over which scholars have consensus. Hence, design and deploying of systems for urban growth prediction have remained challenging tasks. In order to reduce the dependency on human devised features, we have proposed a novel End-to-End prediction framework to represent remotely sensed satellite data in terms of rules of a cellular automata model in order to improve the performance of urban growth prediction. Using our End-to-End framework, we have achieved superior performance in Figure of Merit, Producer's accuracy, User's accuracy, and Overall accuracy metrics respectively over existing learning based methods.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Saptarshi  Pal", "Soumya K.

As EV users' satisfaction depends on reliable and value-stable products, car manufacturers offer charging assistants for simplified and sustainable EV usage by considering individual customer needs and battery aging. Hitherto models to quantify battery aging have limited practicability due to a complex execution. Data-driven methods hold feasible alternatives for SOH estimation. However, the existing approaches barely use user-related data. By means of a linear and a neural network regression model, we first estimate the energy consumption for driving considering individual driving styles and environmental conditions. In following work, the consumption model trained on data from batteries without degradation can be used to estimate the energy consumption for EVs with aged batteries.

One of the most important criteria for determining the suitability of a building for rooftop solar is the current age of its roof.

In this paper we present a data-driven method for determining the age of a roof from historical satellite imagery, which removes one of the last obstacles to a fully automated pipeline for rooftop solar site selection.

Vehicular Ad Hoc Network (VANET) supports wireless connections among vehicles and offers information exchange, thus significantly facilitating intelligent transportation systems. Since the vehicles move fast and often change lanes unpredictably, the network topology evolves rapidly in a random fashion, which imposes diverse challenges in routing protocol design over VANET. When it comes to the 5G era, the fulfilment of ultra low end-to-end delay and ultra high reliability becomes more crucial than ever. In this paper, we propose a novel routing protocol that incorporates mobility status and MAC layer channel contention information. The proposed routing protocol determines next hop by applying mobility information and MAC contention information which differs from existing greedy perimeter stateless routing (GPSR) protocol. First, we use mobility information to estimate link expiration time and distance. Second, a mathematical model of backoff times is proposed based on the MAC layer backoff mechanism. Therefore, the MAC delay of each forwarding node can be evaluated on this basis. Finally, we combine these three aspects to evaluate the forwarding probability of each node.

Part I: Operations in a closed mode", "abstract": "This paper provides a description of a new method for information processing based on holistic approach wherein analysis is a direct product of synthesis. The core of the method is iterative averaging of all the elements of a system according to all the parameters describing the elements. Contrary to common logic, the iterative averaging of a system's elements does not result in homogenization of the system; instead, it causes an obligatory subdivision of the system into two alternative subgroups, leaving no outliers. Within each of the formed subgroups, similarity coefficients between the elements reach the value of 1, whereas similarity coefficients between the elements of different subgroups equal a certain constant value greater than 0 but lower than 1. When subjected to iterative averaging, any system consisting of three or more elements of which at least two elements are not completely identical undergo such a process of bifurcation that occurs non-linearly. Successive iterative averaging of each of the forming subgroups eventually provides a hierarchical system that reflects relationships between the elements of an input system under analysis. We propose a definition of a natural hierarchy that can exist only in conditions of closeness of a system and can be discovered upon providing such an effect onto a system which allows its elements interact with each other based on the principle of self-organization. Self-organization can be achieved through an overall and total cross-averaging of a system's elements.

The trade-off between the sine wave rejection ratio of the technique and the test time response is studied and, in the case of a MEMS accelerometer, it is demonstrated that the rejection is higher than 14dB for a test time of about 0.7s.

We carry out extensive simulation experiments to validate JOET.

Even though some countries, including the Security Big Six (SB6), are equipped with their security books and may feel relatively safe; this remains a wrong sense of security as long as they share their networks with entities of less security. The standards impose security best practices and system specifications for the development of information security management systems. Partners beyond borders have to be secure as this is only possible if all entities connected to the partnership remain secure. Unfortunately, there is no way to verify the continuous security of partners without periodic security auditing and certification, and members who do not comply should be barred from the partnership.

There are various types of scheduling schemes existing for meeting the critical task assignment in multiple processor environments and it requires the tracking of faulty conditions of the subsystem to avoid system underperformance from failure patterns. Hybrid scheduling usually engages a combined scheduling philosophy comprising of a static scheduling of a set of tasks and a highly pre-emptive scheduling for another set of tasks in different situations of process control. There are instances where highly critical tasks need to be introduced at a least expected catastrophe and it cannot be ensured to meet all deadline in selected processors because of the arrival pattern of such tasks and they bear low tolerance of time to meet the required target.

Despite its statistical promise as an alternative to the lasso, square-root lasso, and scaled lasso, the TREX is computationally challenging in that it requires solving a nonconvex optimization problem. This article shows a remarkable result: despite the nonconvexity of the TREX problem, there exists a polynomial-time algorithm that is guaranteed to find the global minimum. This result adds the TREX to a very short list of nonconvex optimization problems that can be globally optimized (principal components analysis being a famous example). After deriving and developing this new approach, we demonstrate that (i) the ability of the preexisting TREX heuristic to reach the global minimum is strongly dependent on the difficulty of the underlying statistical problem, (ii) the new polynomial-time algorithm for TREX permits a novel variable ranking and selection scheme, (iii) this scheme can be incorporated into a rule that controls the false discovery rate (FDR) of included features in the model. To achieve this last aim, we provide an extension of the results of Barber and Candes to establish that the knockoff filter framework can be applied to the TREX. This investigation thus provides both a rare case study of a heuristic for nonconvex optimization and a novel way of exploiting nonconvexity for statistical inference.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Jacob  Bien", "Irina  Gaynanova", "Johannes  Lederer", "Christian L.

In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning-based FPGA function block detection method with three major steps. In specific, we first analyze the format of the bitstream to obtain the mapping relationship between the configuration bits and configurable logic blocks because of the discontinuity of the configuration bits in the bitstream for one element. In order to reap the maturity of object detection techniques based on deep learning, our next step is to convert an FPGA bitstream to an image, following the proposed transformation method that takes account of both the adjacency nature of the programmable logic and the high degree of redundancy of configuration information. Once the image is obtained, a deep learning-based object detection algorithm is applied to this transformed image, and the objects detected can be reflected back to determine the function blocks of the original FPGA design. The deep neural network used for function block detection is trained and validated with a specially crafted bitstream/image dataset. Experiments have confirmed high detection accuracy of the proposed function detection method, showing a 98.11% of mean Average Precision (IoU = 0.5) for 10 function blocks within a YOLOv3 detector implemented on Xilinx Zynq-7000 SoCs and Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoCs.", "venue": "IEEE Access", "authors": ["Minzhen  Chen", "Peng  Liu"], "year": 2021, "n_citations": 0}

In that regard, modulated backscattering (MB) is a promising design choice, in which sensor nodes send their data just by switching their antenna impedance and reflecting the incident signal coming from an RF source.

Previous studies have reported that under specific conditions, i.e. when a random train of Poissonian distributed spikes are used as inputs, and weight changes occur according to STDP, it has been shown that the BCM rule is an emergent property. Here, the applied STDP rule can be either classical pair-based STDP rule, or the more powerful triplet-based STDP rule. In this paper, we demonstrate the use of two distinct VLSI circuit implementations of STDP to examine whether BCM learning is an emergent property of STDP. These circuits are stimulated with random Poissonian spike trains. The first circuit implements the classical pair-based STDP, while the second circuit realizes a previously described triplet-based STDP rule. These two circuits are simulated using 0.35 \u03bcm CMOS standard model in HSpice simulator. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed triplet-based STDP circuit significantly produces the threshold-based behaviour of the BCM. Also, the results testify to similar behaviour for the VLSI circuit for pair-based STDP in generating the BCM.", "venue": "The 2012 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)", "authors": ["Mostafa Rahimi Azghadi", "Said F.

Many energy disaggregation algorithms have been proposed to detect various individual appliances from one aggregated signal observation. However, few works studied the energy disaggregation of plug-in electric vehicle (EV) charging in the residential environment since EVs charging at home has emerged only recently. Recent studies showed that EV charging has a large impact on smart-grid especially in summer. Therefore, EV charging monitoring has become a more important and urgent missing piece in energy disaggregation. In this paper, we present a novel method to disaggregate EV charging signals from aggregated real power signals. The proposed method can effectively mitigate interference coming from air-conditioner (AC), enabling accurate EV charging detection and energy estimation under the presence of AC power signals.

Electric load profiles of tropical islands in developed countries are characterised by morning, midday and evening peaks arising from all year round high power demand in the commercial and residential sectors, mostly due to air conditioning appliances and bad thermal conception of the building. In early 1995, a DSM pilot initiative has been launched in the french islands of Guadeloupe and Reunion through a partnership between the French Public Utility EDF, institutions involved in energy conservation, environment preservation (ADEME) and construction quality improvment, the University of Reunion Island and several other public and private partners (low cost housing institutions, architects, energy consultant, etc...) to set up a standard in the thermal conception of buildings in tropical climates. This has led to definition of optimized bioclimatic urban planning and architectural design, the use of passive cooling architectural components, natural ventilation and energy efficient systems. The impact of each technical solution on the thermal comfort within the building was evaluated with an airflow and thermal building simulation software (CODYRUN). These technical solutions have been edited in a pedagogical reference document and have been implemented in 300 new pilot dwelling projects through the year 1996 in Reunion Island and in Guadeloupe island. An experimental follow up is still in process in the first ECODOM dwellings for an experimental validation of the impact of the passive cooling solutions on the comfort of the occupants and to modify them if necessary.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Fran\u00e7ois  Garde", "Harry  Boyer", "Robert  Celaire", "Laurent  Seauve"], "year": 2012, "n_citations": 0}

These servers consume huge energy without performing useful work. In an average server environment, 30% of the servers are \"dead\" only consuming energy, without being properly utilized.

CAM software can help in estimating that time for a given strategy. But in practice, CAM-programmed feed rates are rarely achieved, especially where complex surface finishing is concerned.

The reason behind this is that CAM routines do not take either the dynamic performances of the machines or their specific machining tolerances into account. The present article seeks to improve simulation of high-speed NC machine dynamic behaviour and machining time prediction, offering two models. The first contributes through enhanced simulation of three-axis paths in linear and circular interpolation, taking high-speed machine accelerations and jerks into account. The second model allows transition passages between blocks to be integrated in the simulation by adding in a polynomial transition path that caters for the true machining environment tolerances. Models are based on respect for path monitoring. Experimental validation shows the contribution of polynomial modelling of the transition passage due to the absence of a leap in acceleration.

The first step of this process is coverage prediction, which can be performed by interpolating geo-located measurements reported to the network by mobile user's equipments. In the previous works, we proposed a low complexity coverage prediction algorithm based on the adaptation of the geo-statistics fixed rank kriging (FRK) algorithm. We supposed that the geo-location information reported with the radio measurements was perfect, which is not the case in reality. In this paper, we study the impact of location uncertainty on the coverage prediction accuracy and we extend the previously proposed algorithm to include geo-location error in the prediction model. We validate the proposed algorithm using both simulated and real-field measurements. The FRK is extended to take into account that the location uncertainty proves to enhance the prediction accuracy while keeping a reasonable computational complexity.", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications", "authors": ["Hajer  Braham", "Sana Ben Jemaa", "Gersende  Fort", "Eric  Moulines", "Berna  Sayra\u00e7"], "year": 2016, "n_citations": 17}

This multistage approach enables efficient training of the network even when limited training data is available. More significantly, in FBCNet, we propose a novel Variance layer that effectively aggregates the EEG time-domain information.

The results show that, by achieving 76.20% 4-class classification accuracy, FBCNet sets a new SOTA for BCIC-IV-2a dataset. On the other three datasets, FBCNet yields up to 8% higher binary classification accuracies.

There is somehow room for yet another class of systems complementary to existing embedded systems complementing distributed operating systems which takes on an interdisciplinary cyber-physical-materiality approach, a dedicated holistic perspective that recognizes the true value of interdisciplinary mastery vs. the implicit and overlooked expense of narrow intra-disciplinary focus dominating much of systems development (e.g. EE, CE, CS, SE, and IS). Interdisciplinary mastery yields its accumulated value across the development, deployment, use, re-use, and decommission phases for this class of systems: DEMoS is a system architected to be locally distributed, embedded, and modular as outlined herein and with the additional goals of human interdisciplinary mastery in this context: A potential set of goals for developing and applying DEMoS can be found in UN Resolution 70/1. In DEMoS [6] (demos also means \u2019common people\u2019 ), the host SW tooling is mainly limited to multi-paradigm languages with open source implementations, e.g. the succinct F# (in close competition with say C#, but also other languages). For low-level HW description/verification, the Verilog HDL family is (with no serious competition) chosen: System Verilog emerging as the likely specific candidate. It is considered if transpiling (a sync./async. variant) of F# to (System) Verilog is worth-while endeavor in one form or the other. On the embedded side, it would seem that any language with compiler support for the implemented instruction set is possible. However, multiple source language support (even from within the native .NET family) is most likely not practical on the target side (polyglot programming is harder in the embedded space!). In this case, F# [8] seems to offer a realistic compromise between the different programming paradigms (supporting both functional and/or OO programming. For PCB support of being distributed and modular, a system based on high-density interconnects is considered. Interconnects are currently thought to be based on Z-Ray\u00ae 1.0 mm micro arrays, and I call it ZMOD. Considering also soldering, it, ZMOD, would make a kind of two-sided PCB available, while only demanding single sided SMD processes; not an irrelevant consideration from a 1 ar X iv :1 61 2. 04 19 1v 1 [ cs .O H ] 1 1 D ec 2 01 6 maker perspective [1]. IO and some aspects of system control is thought to include use of PC/mobile phone audio ports with supporting target circuitry. For example, it opens up for programs or apps that support the the developer in some situations and the users in other scenarios. Just consider trouble-shooting complete (perhaps even remote) systems like drones, autonomous cars, robots, vessels or smaller power plant set-ups. Furthermore, is it considered what USB/JTAG solution to use. FTDI offers non-programmable and programmable USB solutions. Programmable USB solutions (e.g. VNC2) offer one way to deal with some IO mess (like audIO/UART/SPI/modems/WiFi/WiFi beacon-based protocols/BT/NFC/JTAG etc.), but with the annoyance of another SDK to learn. For low-speed/high-speed, small/wide, and wired/wireless interconnects to other cores, systems, transceivers, etc., a language independent specification is considered to be useful. For instance, to define mods based on the Z-Ray\u00ae micro arrays, XML or JSON-LD seem good formats for this task. Another interconnect type that might prove useful is the wellknown ethernet cable, as it is easy to cut into any desired length and connect to other \u201ddistant\u201d (centimeters to meters away) DEMoS systems. Within one DEMoS system, a specialized processor, targeting the CIL instructions, called CILOP, is situated between DEMoS and the physical cores. One CILOP is similar to one Java Optimized Processor [7]. The (physical) cores, currently referred to as Thunder-cores (TCORE), are sought to have a non-rigid relationship to the operating system modules thus achieving distribution primarily within the embedded context. One DEMoS could encompass many CILOPS, and those CILOPs could be run over multiple TCOREs, and those TCOREs could be spread across multiple FPGAs. It should be noted that a future, but both difficult and expensive, yet very interesting, option would be to \u201dharden\u201d the CILOP using services such as \u201dThe MOSIS Service\u201d. Coming back to the context, and thus the meaning of being distributed, is different for embedded systems than for general distributed (operating) systems [3]. Distributed execution i.e. as in one robot demands extreme care and understanding of the development environments/tools/processes as it is not trivial to develop multiple systems (with separate debug cables etc.) as one conceptional DEMoS. A basic un-distributed canonical implementation could consist of just one DEMoS running in one Thunder-core. Thunder-cores must support efficient average execution as well as real time applications. Needed ML/AI precision should be addressed by sensible FPU [2] support carefully balancing both FPGA cost and library implementation. Thunder-cores execute on an ISA currently aligned to ECMA-335, Partition III, because it is important to retain a close link to the fundamental binary execution units (.DLL and .exe). Flexible hardware is chosen in the form of affordable FPGAs/CPLDs, which allows more room for form to follow function, and function to follow form, in a wide spectrum of imaginable use cases with the developer possibly taking on an additional action research role. To support and exploit the marvelous FPGAs, specialized hardware is considered, such as optimized memory modules for garbage collection, stack fill/spill, context switching, process/app/OS migration, virtualization, and (large) (shared) caches; the latter most likely an important component to achieve meaningful distribution of data and computation.

Hence, commercial and crowd-sourced mapping services heavily use human annotation to minimize the mapping errors. Consequently, their response to changes in the road network is inevitably slow. In this paper we describe \\mapfuse, a system which fuses a human-annotated map (e.g., OpenStreetMap) with any automatically inferred map, thus effectively enabling quick map updates.

The first problem is the reconstruction of the angular-domain periodogram from spatial-domain signals received at different time indices. The second one is the reconstruction of the frequency-domain periodogram from time-domain signals received at different wireless sensors. We split the entire angular or frequency band into uniform bins. The bin size is set such that the received spectra at two frequencies or angles, whose distance is equal to or larger than the size of a bin, are uncorrelated. These problems in the two different domains lead to a similar circulant structure in the so-called coset correlation matrix. This circulant structure allows for a strong compression and a simple least-squares reconstruction method. The latter is possible under the full column rank condition of the system matrix, which can be achieved by designing the spatial or temporal sampling patterns based on a circular sparse ruler. We analyze the statistical performance of the compressively reconstructed periodogram, including bias and variance. We further consider the case when the bins are so small that the received spectra at two frequencies or angles, with a spacing between them larger than the size of the bin, can still be correlated. In this case, the resulting coset correlation matrix is generally not circulant and thus a special approach is required.", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing", "authors": ["Dyonisius Dony Ariananda", "Daniel  Romero", "Geert  Leus"], "year": 2015, "n_citations": 3}

Generally a SSD consists of a number of flash memory chips, some buffers of the volatile memory type, and an embedded microprocessor, which have been interconnected by a port. This microprocessor run a small file system which called flash translation layer (FTL). This software controls and schedules buffers, data transfers and all flash memory tasks.

Consequently, larger amounts of data must be acquired and processed by the beamformer. The significant growth in the amounts of data effects both machinery size and power consumption. Within the classical sampling framework, state of the art systems reduce processing rates by exploiting the bandpass bandwidth of the detected signals. It has been recently shown, that a much more significant sample-rate reduction may be obtained, by treating ultrasound signals within the Finite Rate of Innovation framework. These ideas follow the spirit of Xampling, which combines classic methods from sampling theory with recent developments in Compressed Sensing. Applying such low-rate sampling schemes to individual transducer elements, which detect energy reflected from biological tissues, is limited by the noisy nature of the signals. This often results in erroneous parameter extraction, bringing forward the need to enhance the SNR of the low-rate samples.

This segmentation according to contextual graphic and qualitative criteria connecting the attached allograph will have to satisfy typographic constraints varying in conformity with the possibilities offered by the wanted technology. In this paper, we develop an approach for segmenting Arabic word from which the purpose is to extract graphemes respecting the design of Arabic letters such as it is in the calligraphic literature.

Current approaches for quantifying the output accuracy of a localization system in real-time either do not provide a distance metric, require an extensive training process, and/or are tailored to a specific localization system. In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of CONE: a novel calibration-free accurate confidence estimation system that can work in real-time with any location determination system. CONE builds on a sound theoretical model that allows it to trade the required user confidence with tight bound on the estimated confidence radius. We also introduce a new metric for evaluating confidence estimation systems that can capture new aspects of their performance. Evaluation of CONE on Android phones in a typical testbed using the iBeacons BLE technology with a side-by-side comparison with traditional confidence estimation techniques shows that CONE can achieve a consistent median absolute error difference accuracy of less than 2.7m while estimating the user position more than 80% of the time within the confidence circle.

In modern times, spatial data mining has emerged as an area of voluminous research.

The fast or early detection of forest fires is a vital element for controlling such phenomenon. The application of remote sensing is at present a significant method for forest fires monitoring, particularly in vast and remote areas. Different methods have been presented by researchers for forest fire detection. The motivation behind this research is to obtain beneficial information from images in the forest spatial data and use the same in the determination of regions at the risk of fires by utilizing Image Processing and Artificial Intelligence techniques. This paper presents an intelligent system to detect the presence of forest fires in the forest spatial data using Artificial Neural Networks. The digital images in the forest spatial data are converted from RGB to XYZ color space and then segmented by employing anisotropic diffusion to identify the fire regions. Subsequently, Radial Basis Function Neural Network is employed in the design of the intelligent system, which is trained with the color space values of the segmented fire regions.

However, this technique requires the transmitter to have perfect knowledge of the channel which is often not available a priori. A solution to overcome this problem is to design the beamforming vector using a limited number of feedback bits sent from the receiver to the transmitter. In the case of limited feedback, the beamforming vector is limited to lie in a codebook that is known to both the transmitter and receiver.When the feedback is strictly limited, important issues are how to quantize the information needed at the transmitter and how much improvement in associated performance can be obtained as a function of the amount of feedback available.In this paper channel quantization schema using simple approach to codebook design (random vector quantization)is illustrated.

Sourcing and outsourcing are positioned as different areas of activity, neither one of which is subsumed under the other one. It is argued that competences relevant for outsourcing are mainly community based rather than evidence based. Subjective ability and objective ability are distinguished as categories, together making up ability, which are distinct but not necessarily disjoint from competence. Conjectural ability is introduced as a form of subjective ability. A person\u2019s competence profile includes competences as well as abilities, including subjective ones. Competence assessment and acquisition as well as the impact of assessed competence on practical work is described. The analysis of competence and ability thus developed is used as standpoint from which to extract a specification of an audience for a theory of outsourcing, yet to be written. Moreover, it allows to formulate requirements for and in preparation of the development of an outsourcing theory. Formulating these requirements is done under the assumption that a person\u2019s awareness of a theory of outsourcing is expected to strengthen that person\u2019s outsourcing competence profile.

The aim of the paper is to present a method to evaluate the effect of high-speed and high dynamic load on volumetric errors at the tool center point. The interpolator output signals and the machine encoder signals are recorded and compared to evaluate the contouring errors resulting from each axis follow-up error. The machine encoder signals are also compared to the actual tool center point position as recorded with a non-contact measuring instrument called CapBall to evaluate the total geometric errors. The novelty of the work lies in the method that is proposed to decompose the geometric errors into two categories: the quasi-static geometric errors independent from the speed of the trajectory and the dynamic geometric errors, dependent on the programmed feed rate and resulting from the machine structure deflection during the acceleration of its axes. The evolution of the respective contributions for contouring errors, quasi-static geometric errors and dynamic geometric errors is experimentally evaluated and a relation between programmed feed rate and dynamic errors is highlighted.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Lo\u00efc  Andolfatto", "Sylvain  Lavernhe", "Ren\u00e9  Mayer"], "year": 2011, "n_citations": 84}

A distributed fusion with the weighted sum structure is applied to the optimal local limited memory predictors. The distributed prediction algorithm represents the optimal linear fusion by weighting matrices under the minimum mean square criterion. The algorithm has the parallel structure and allows parallel processing of observations making it reliable since the rest faultless sensors can continue to the fusion estimation if some sensors occur faulty. The derivation of equations for error cross-covariances between the local predictors is the key of this paper. Example demonstrates effectiveness of the distributed limited memory predictor.

If there are no constraints on communication channels and proces-sor bandwidths, complete measurements can be brought to a central processor for data processing. In this case, sensors act as simple data collectors and do not perform any data processing. One of the advantages of this centra-lized processing is that it involves minimal information loss. However, it can result in severe computational over-head. Also, there needs to be a somewhat ideal assump-tion on the environment mentioned above. In practice, especially when sensors are dispersed over a wide geographic area, there are limitations on the amount of communications allowed among sensors. Also, sensors are provided with processing capabilities. In this case, a certain amount of computation can be performed at the individual sensors and a compressed version of sensor data can be transmitted to a fusion center where the re-ceived information is appropriately combined to yield the global inference. The advantage of the distribution of fil-ters is that the parallel structures would lead to increase the input data rates and make easy fault detection and isolation. However, the accuracy of the distributed filter or predictor is generally lower than of the centralized fil-ter. Various distributed and parallel versions of the stan-dard Kalman filter have been reported for linear dynamic systems [2-8]. To get a more accurate estimate of a state of system under potential uncertainty, various kinds of techniques have been introduced and discussed. Among them, a limited memory technique called receding horizon, which is ro-bust against temporal uncertainty, has been rigorously investigated [9-12]. In this paper, we study the distributed receding horizon fusion prediction for the continuous-time linear systems with multiple sensors. The local re-ceding horizon predictors (LRHPs), which we fuse, utilize finite measurements over the most recent time interval [9-12]. It has been a general rule that the LRHPs are often robust against dynamic model uncertainties and numeri-cal errors than the standard filters, which utilize all mea-surements. Based on the LRHPs [10, 12] and the optimal fusion formula with matrix weights [8, 13], we propose a distributed receding horizon predictor which has a better accuracy than every LRHP, and it has the reduced com-putational burden as compared to the centralized reced-ing horizon predictor (CRHP). This paper is organized as follows. The problem is set up in Section II. The CRHP is described in Section III. In Section IV, we present the main result regarding the dis-tributed receding horizon predictor (DRHP) for multisen-sor environment. Here the key equations for cross-covariances between LRHPs are derived. In Section V, example illustrates performance of the CRHP and DRHP. In Section VI, concluding remarks are given", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Ha Ryong Song", "Vladimir  Shin"], "year": 2010, "n_citations": 0}

Our system uses passive tags which are maintenance-free and can be embedded into the clothes to reduce the wearing and maintenance efforts. A small RFID reader is also worn on the user's body to extend the detection coverage as the user moves. We exploit RFID radio patterns and extract both spatial and temporal features to characterize various activities. We also address the issues of false negative of tag readings and tag/antenna calibration, and design a fast online recognition system. Antenna and tag selection is done automatically to explore the minimum number of devices required to achieve target accuracy. We develop a prototype system which consists of a wearable RFID system and a smartphone to demonstrate the working principles, and conduct experimental studies with four subjects over two weeks.

Prominent examples of such models are based on pure delay channels (P), inertial delay channels (I), or the elaborate Delay Degradation Model (DDM) channels proposed by Bellido-Diaz et al. We accomplish our goal by considering the border between solvability and non-solvability of a simple problem called short-pulse filtration (SPF), which is closely related to arbitration and synchronization. On one hand, we prove that SPF is solvable in bounded time in any such model that provides channels with non constant delay, like I and DDM. This is in opposition to the impossibility of solving bounded SPF in real (physical) circuit models. On the other hand, for binary circuit models with constant-delay channels, we prove that SPF cannot be solved even in unbounded time; again in opposition to physical circuit models. Consequently, indeed none of the binary value-domain models proposed so far (and that we are aware of) faithfully captures glitch propagation of real circuits.

With this work we aimed to establish dynamical interactions students-content-teacher in order to overcome a diagnosed students\u2019 lack of effort towards studying curriculum chemistry content. Our methodology design is a non experimental and descriptive one, carried out in a secondary school during a whole school year, in order to answer the question \u201cHow to improve the engagement of K-12 students in chemistry classes?\u201d. Students, gathered in small groups, were asked to create digital learning resources (DLR) during classes. The teacher assumed the role of the supervisor, coacher and facilitator of every task that had to be taken or chosen by the students. To enhance interaction student-student and student-teacher, a Twitter account and a Ning community were created for the class. Both supported the Social Learning Environment (SLE) that was intended to be created. The data collected \u2010 DLR created, participation of each student in the Ning community, teacher observations and students\u2019 opinions \u2010 led us to satisfactory results in what concerns the goals of this exploratory study. We based our research in the following facts: i) the development of a technological basis in education is a social demand and therefore its adoption in a systemic way is no longer a matter of choice; ii) our \u201cdigital native\u201d students have different learning styles not considered by traditional instructional practices; iii) SLE promotes and supports collaborative learning through the use of student-created content; iv) involving innovative pedagogical approaches opens up opportunities to engage students in creative learning and can possibly help bridge gaps between innovative and conventional pedagogical approaches and v) the use of well-structured technology, in certain contexts, may have a significant and positive effect on students\u2019 achievements. SLE has been shaped by experience and this study is about that: web 2.0 tools, social media and student-generated content were used to answer to a combination of curriculum very specific skills and the needs and desires of the students. The affordances and constraints of SLE as an open architecture that has potential to facilitate collaborative learning are delineated. The methodology followed out allowed an interaction from many to many and an increased students\u2019 engagement in the proposed tasks. SLE developed ICT skills and established itself as a cognitive tool: students accessed information about learning content and turned it into knowledge. The results seem to demonstrate that TPE, by allowing the ubiquity of computers in schools, let students to be more engaged in working and came out to be a facilitator for integrating ICT in the curriculum. Our findings are important for the Portuguese teachers who still withstand, before these \u201cNet Generation\u201d students, to experimenting pedagogical approaches that integrate ICT into real teaching contexts which is now an imperative cause.

It proposes to cluster nodes together using Recursive-DBSCAN - an algorithm that recursively applies DBSCAN until clusters below the preset maximum number of nodes are obtained. That approach leads to 61% decrease in runtimes of the CVRPTW solver as benchmarked against Google Optimization Tools, while the difference of total distance and number of vehicles used by found solutions is below 7%. The improvement of runtimes with the Recursive-DBSCAN method is because of splitting the node-set into constituent clusters, which limits the number of solutions checked by the solver, consequently reducing the runtime. The proposed method consumes less memory and is able to find solutions for problems up to 5000 nodes, while the baseline Google Optimisation Tools solves problems up to 2000 nodes.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Kamil  Bujel", "Feiko  Lai", "Michal  Szczecinski", "Winnie  So", "Miguel  Fernandez"], "year": 2018, "n_citations": 7}

When acid concentration, solution temperatures and line speed are not properly balanced, in fact, sheet defects like under pickling or over pickling may happen and their occurrence does have a very serious effect on cold-reduction performance and surface appearance of the finished product.

For the Scottish Football Association (SFA), the allocation of referees and other officials to matches is governed by a number of rules specifying the expertise required from the different types of official at each level, e.g. Scottish Premiership League referee must be a grade 1 with high experience. The allocation requires an SFA secretary to expend several hours to find suitable officials, contact them and assign them. Most of the time, the secretary is a volunteer who performs the allocation as a hobby and it would be useful to reduce his costs and time. \nThe project aims to reduce the burden on SFA, and potentially other secretaries, by developing a program to assign SFA officials. A suitable algorithm must be devised to search through the set of data about matches and officials and find a potential allocation. The program then updates the database with the new data, and provides a web interface for both secretaries and officials. \nA prototype system using the new greedy algorithm has been implemented and evaluated with SFA secretaries. A final usable referee allocation system has been designed that uses the greedy algorithm, and is extended after evaluation of the prototype.

The system uses a technique that is based on a frequency shift in reflected energy to detect a movement or change in position (motion). In this system, ultrasonic sound is transmitted from the transmitting device which is normally in the form of energy. The transmitted sound utilizes air as its medium and this travel in a wave type motion. The wave is reflected back from the surroundings in the room/hallway and the device hears a pitch characteristic of the protected environment. In this system, the wave pattern is disturbed and reflected back more quickly, thus increasing the pitch and signaling an alarm whenever motion is detected. The main contribution of this work is the design of a circuit that can sense motion through movement of anything, a low cost and portable motion detector, and thedesignof a circuit that can be used to trigger another circuit whether to ON or OFF depending on the circuit attached to it. Generally, the design is made to detect movement or moving object in a an enclosed area. In this work, a transmitter transducer generates a signal at a frequency of 40khz, and when the signal is blocked by any moving object, and this in turn, triggers a buzzer via a timing circuit. This system works on the principle of the signal interference by a moving body, and the system is dependent on the presence of an intruder or moving object within a monitored area.

However, they may suffer from metastability. Based on the experience that the cascading of flip-flop stages yields a dramatic improvement of their overall metastability hardness, in this paper we elaborate on the question whether the cascading of Schmitt-Trigger stages can obtain a similar gain. We perform a theoretic analysis that is backed up by an existing metastability model for a single Schmitt-Trigger stage and elaborate some claims about the behavior of a Schmitt-Trigger cascade. These claims suggest that the occurrence of metastability is indeed reduced from the first stage to the second which suggests an improvement. On the downside, however, it becomes clear that metastability can still not be completely ruled out, and in some cases the behavior of the cascade may be less beneficial for a given application, e.g. by introducing seemingly acausal transitions.

When these two disciplines inform each other semiotics is provided with mathematical mechanism and Bayesian inference is seen to be closely related to the act of distinction, the fundamental basis of logic in the work of Spencer-Brown. This hybridization also suggests a definition for knowledge within Bayesian inference; a definition that has been curiously lacking. Given that Darwinian processes are physical implementations of Bayesian inference and are utilized within numerous scientific theories across a wide range of disciplines as mechanisms for the creation and evolution of knowledge we may view the conjunction of these theories, within universal Darwinism, as descriptive of a world mind.

Results from ergonomics (BEST, Guidelines for shiftworkers, Bulletin of European Time Studies No. 3, European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, 1991) indicate that rotating workforce schedules have a profound impact on the health and satisfaction of employees as well as on their performance at work. Moreover, rotating workforce schedules must satisfy legal requirements and should also meet the objectives of the employing organization. In this paper, our description of a solution to this problem is being stated. One of the basic design decisions was to aim at high-quality schedules for realistically sized problems obtained rather quickly, while maintaining human control. The interaction between the decision-maker and the algorithm therefore consists of four steps: (1) choosing a set of lengths of work blocks (a work block is a sequence of consecutive days of work), (2) choosing a particular sequence of blocks of work and days-off blocks amongst these that have optimal weekend characteristics, (3) enumerating possible shift sequences for the chosen work blocks subject to shift change constraints and bounds on sequences of shifts, and (4) assignment of shift sequences to work blocks while fulfilling the staffing requirements. The combination of constraint satisfaction and problem-oriented intelligent backtracking algorithms in each of the four steps allows for finding good solutions for real-world problems in acceptable time. Computational results from a benchmark example found in the literature confirmed the viability of our approach.

The pump is constructed of a upper glass plate, two glass tubes, a PDMS (polydimethylsilxane) diaphragm with an electromagnetic actuating mechanism and a glass substrate. The actuating mechanism comprises an electroplated permanent magnet mounted on a flexible PDMS diaphragm and electroplated Cu coils located on a glass substrate. The upper glass plate, PDMS diaphragm and the glass substrate were aligned and assembled to form a micro channel with a compressible section surrounded by a rigid section, creating an acoustic mismatch in the channel. The electromagnetic force between the magnet and the Cu coils causes the diaphragm to deflect and then creates the accumulative effects of wave propagation and reflection at the junction of the compressible and rigid sections. The resulting pressure gradient in the fluid drives the flow from the inlet to the outlet of the micropump. The constituent parts of the electromagnetic actuator, namely the diaphragm, the microcoils, and the magnet are modeled and analyzed in order to optimize the actuator design. The design models are verified both theoretically and numerically and the relationships between the magnetic force, diaphragm displacement, and diaphragm strength are established. The magnitude of the magnetic force acting on the flexible diaphragm are calculated using Ansoft/Maxwell3D FEA software and the resulting diaphragm deflection simulated by ANSYS FEA software are found to agree with the theoretical predictions. Different diaphragm shapes are investigated and their relative strength and flexibility are compared. It is found that a circular PDMS diaphragm represents the most appropriate choice for the actuating mechanism in the micropump. The desired diaphragm deflection of 15 m \uf06d is obtained using a compression force of 16 N \uf06d , generated by a coil input current of 0.9A. The diaphragm deflection can be regulated by varying the current passed through the microcoil and hence the flow rate can be controlled. The valveless micro impedance pump proposed in this study is easily fabricated and can be readily integrated with existing biomedical chips.

Unfortunately, it was recently proved [F\\\"ugger et al., ASYNC'13] that no existing binary-valued circuit model proposed so far, including the two most commonly used pure and inertial delay channels, faithfully captures glitch propagation: For the simple Short-Pulse Filtration (SPF) problem, which is related to a circuit's ability to suppress a single glitch, we showed that the quite broad class of bounded single-history channels either contradict the unsolvability of SPF in bounded time or the solvability of SPF in unbounded time in physical circuits. \nIn this paper, we propose a class of binary circuit models that do not suffer from this deficiency: Like bounded single-history channels, our involution channels involve delays that may depend on the time of the previous output transition. Their characteristic property are delay functions which are based on involutions, i.e., functions that form their own inverse. A concrete example of such a delay function, which is derived from a generalized first-order analog circuit model, reveals that this is not an unrealistic assumption. We prove that, in sharp contrast to what is possible with bounded single-history channels, SPF cannot be solved in bounded time due to the nonexistence of a lower bound on the delay of involution channels, whereas it is easy to provide an unbounded SPF implementation. It hence follows that binary-valued circuit models based on involution channels allow to solve SPF precisely when this is possible in physical circuits. To the best of our knowledge, our model is hence the very first candidate for a model that indeed guarantees faithful glitch propagation.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Matthias  F\u00fcgger", "Robert  Najvirt", "Thomas  Nowak", "Ulrich  Schmid"], "year": 2014, "n_citations": 2}

Grid cells are widely believed to be involved in path integration, that is, the maintenance of a location state through the summation of small displacements. We provide theoretical evidence for this assertion by showing that cells with grid-like tuning curves are indeed well adapted for the path integration task. In particular we prove that, in one dimension under Gaussian noise, the sensitivity of measuring small displacements is maximized by a population of neurons whose tuning curves are near-sinusoids -- that is to say, with peaks forming a one-dimensional grid. We also show that effective computation of the displacement is possible through a second population of cells whose sinusoid tuning curves are in phase difference from the first. In two dimensions, under additional assumptions it can be shown that measurement sensitivity is optimized by the product of two sinusoids, again yielding a grid-like pattern.

FireFly drone-based rescue consists of a squad of highly equipped drones that will be the first responders to the fire site. Their intervention will make the task of the fire rescue team much more effective and will contribute to reduce the overall damage. As soon as the fire is detected by in-building implanted sensors, the fire department would deploy a set of FireFly drones that would fly to the site, scan the building, and send live fire status information to the Fire fighter team. The drones would have the ability to identify trapped humans using AI based pattern recognition tools (using sensors and thermal cameras) and then drop them rescue kits as appropriate. The drones will also be equipped with fire detection and recognition capabilities and be able to drop fire extinguishing balls as first attempts to put off seeds of fires before they evolve. The integration of drones with firefighting will allow for ease of access and control of fire outbreaks.

The effect of such phenomena on system level operation is particularly related to the Static Noise Margins (in idle and read mode) and the Write Noise Margins of memory elements. While Static Noise Margins have been studied in the past, in this work we calculated and compared the effect of process variations and NBTI/PBTI aging on the Write Noise Margins of various MOSFET- and FinFET-based flip-flop cells. The massive transistor-level Monte Carlo simulations produced both nominal (i.e. mean) values and associated standard deviations of the WNMs of the flip-flops. This allowed calculating the consequent write failure probability as a function of an input voltage shift, and assessing a comparison for robustness among different circuit topologies and technologies.

Current solutions for respiratory monitoring, however, are usually invasive and/or limited to medical facilities. In this paper, we propose a novel respiratory monitoring system, UbiBreathe, based on ubiquitous off-the-shelf WiFi-enabled devices. Our experiments show that the received signal strength (RSS) at a WiFi-enabled device held on a person's chest is affected by the breathing process. This effect extends to scenarios when the person is situated on the line-of-sight (LOS) between the access point and the device, even without holding it. UbiBreathe leverages these changes in the WiFi RSS patterns to enable ubiquitous non-invasive respiratory rate estimation, as well as apnea detection. We propose the full architecture and design for UbiBreathe, incorporating various modules that help reliably extract the hidden breathing signal from a noisy WiFi RSS. The system handles various challenges such as noise elimination, interfering humans, sudden user movements, as well as detecting abnormal breathing situations. Our implementation of UbiBreathe using off-the-shelf devices in a wide range of environmental conditions shows that it can estimate different breathing rates with less than 1 breaths per minute (bpm) error. In addition, UbiBreathe can detect apnea with more than 96% accuracy in both the device-on-chest and hands-free scenarios.

Our technique uses integer linear programming, with an energy cost model to select a good set of basic blocks to place into RAM, without impacting stack or data storage.

We firstly explore the question of what kind of simulation in which humanity is most likely located based on pure theoretical reasoning. We suggest a new patch to the classical simulation argument, showing that we are likely simulated not by our own descendants, but by alien civilizations. Based on this, we provide classification of different possible simulations and we find that simpler, less expensive and one-person-centered simulations, resurrectional simulations, or simulations of the first artificial general intelligence's (AGI's) origin (singularity simulations) should dominate. Also, simulations which simulate the 21st century and global catastrophic risks are probable. We then explore whether the simulation could collapse or be terminated. Most simulations must be terminated after they model the singularity or after they model a global catastrophe before the singularity. Undeniably observed glitches, but not philosophical speculations could result in simulation termination. The simulation could collapse if it is overwhelmed by glitches. The Doomsday Argument in simulations implies termination soon.

By applying statistical methods to prior known gene and protein regulatory information, pathway analysis provides a meaningful way to interpret genomic data. While many gene/protein regulatory relationships have been studied, never before has such a significant amount data been made available in organized forms of gene/protein regulatory networks and pathways. However, pathway analysis research is still in its infancy, especially when applying it to solve practical problems. \nIn this paper we propose a new method of studying biological pathways, one that cross analyzes mutation information, transcriptome and proteomics data. Using this outcome, we identify routes of aberrant pathways potentially responsible for the etiology of disease. Each pathway route is encoded as a bayesian network which is initialized with a sequence of conditional probabilities specifically designed to encode directionality of regulatory relationships encoded in the pathways. Far more complex interactions, such as phosphorylation and methylation, among others, in the pathways can be modeled using this approach. The effectiveness of our model is demonstrated through its ability to distinguish real pathways from decoys on TCGA mRNA-seq, mutation, Copy Number Variation and phosphorylation data for both Breast cancer and Ovarian cancer study. The majority of pathways distinguished can be confirmed by biological literature. Moreover, the proportion of correctly indentified pathways is \\% higher than previous work where only mRNA-seq mutation data is incorporated for breast cancer patients. Consequently, such an in-depth pathway analysis incorporating more diverse data can give rise to the accuracy of perturbed pathway detection.", "venue": "ISBRA", "authors": ["Yue  Zhao"], "year": 2018, "n_citations": 1}

The reliability of mmWave links may be compromised due to difficulties in beam alignment for mobile channels and due to blocking effects between a mmWave transmitter and a receiver. To address such challenges, out-of-band information from sub-6 GHz channels can be utilized for predicting the temporal and angular channel characteristics in mmWave bands, which necessitates a good understanding of how propagation characteristics are coupled across different bands. In this paper, we use ray tracing simulations to characterize the angular and temporal correlation across a wide range of propagation frequencies for V2X channels ranging from 900 MHz up to 73 GHz, for a vehicle maintaining line-of-sight (LOS) and non-LOS (NLOS) beams with a transmitter in an urban environment.

In this paper we investigate the ratio of two random number generators as an alternative approach: the smaller of two input random numbers is divided by the larger, resulting in a rational number from $[0,1]$. \nWe investigate theoretical properties of this approach and show that it yields a good approximation to the ideal uniform distribution. To evaluate the empirical properties we use the well-known test suite \\textsc{TestU01}. We apply the ratio transformation to moderately bad generators, i.e. those that failed up to 40\\% of the tests from the test battery \\textsc{Crush} of \\textsc{TestU01}. We show that more than half of them turn into very good generators that pass all tests of \\textsc{Crush} and \\textsc{BigCrush} from \\textsc{TestU01} when the ratio transformation is applied. In particular, generators based on linear operations seem to benefit from the ratio, as this breaks up some of the unwanted regularities in the input sequences.

Due to the spread of hazards, latency in information updating and unstable flows of civilians, emergency evacuation is absolutely a complex transshipment problem involving numerous sources and multiple destinations. Previous algorithms which commonly need either a full graph search or a convergence process suffer from high computational and communication overheads. This research report surveys the current emergency navigation algorithms and adapts the concept of Cognitive Packet Network (CPN) to the context of emergency evacuation. By using random neural networks, the CPN based algorithm can explore optimal routes rapidly and adaptively in a highly dynamic emergency environment with low expense. Simultaneously, in emergency situations there are typically different categories of evacuees such as people of different age groups. However, current algorithms only consider \"normal\" evacuees and do not meet the specific requirements of diverse evacuees. Our algorithms make use of the flexibility of CPN which can operate with different user-defined goals to customize appropriate paths for each category. The CPN algorithm is simulated in a graph based discrete-event simulator and Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm is taken as reference. The results show that the CPN algorithm reaches the performance of ideal path-finding algorithm and quality of service is improved by using specific goal functions for diverse categories of evacuees.

This paper describes the various components of our prototype implementation of a Real-time Passenger Information System (RTPIS) for a public transport system like a fleet of buses. Vehicle-mounted units, bus station units and a server located at the transport company premises comprise the system. The vehicle unit reports the current position of the vehicle to a central server periodically via General Packet Radio Service (GPRS). An Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) algorithm running on the server predicts the arrival times of buses at their stops based on real-time observations of the buses' current Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinates. This information is displayed and announced to passengers at stops using station units, which periodically fetch the required ETA from the server via GPRS. Novel features of our prototype include: (a) a route creator utility which automatically creates new routes from scratch when a bus is driven along the new route, and (b) voice tagging of stops and points of interest along any route. Besides, the prototype provides: (i) web-based applications for passengers, providing useful information like a snapshot of present bus locations on the streets, and (ii) web-based analysis tools for the transport authority, providing information useful for fleet management, like number of trips undertaken by a specific bus. The prototype has been demonstrated in a campus environment, with four-wheelers and two-wheelers emulating buses.

However, the evolution of portable systems and advanced Deep Sub-Micron fabrication technologies have brought power dissipation as another critical design factor. Low power design reduces cooling cost and increases reliability especially for high density systems. Moreover, it reduces the weight and size of portable devices. The power dissipation in CMOS circuits consists of static and dynamic components. Since dynamic power is proportional to V2 dd and static power is proportional to Vdd, lowering the supply voltage and device dimensions, the transistor threshold voltage also has to be scaled down to achieve the required performance. In case of static power, the power is consumed during the steady state condition i.e when there are no input/output transitions. Static power has two sources: DC power and Leakage power. Consecutively to facilitate voltage scaling without disturbing the performance, threshold voltage has to be minimized. Furthermore it leads to better noise margins and helps to avoid the hot carrier effects in short channel devices. In this paper we have been proposed the new CMOS library for the complex digital design using scaling the supply voltage and device dimensions and also suggest the methods to control the leakage current to obtain the minimum power dissipation at optimum value of supply voltage and transistor threshold.

Post Moore's era supercomputing has provided us an opportunity to explore new approaches for traditional graph algorithms on quantum computing architectures. In this work, we explore graph partitioning using quantum annealing on the D-Wave 2X machine. Motivated by a recently proposed graph-based electronic structure theory applied to quantum molecular dynamics (QMD) simulations, graph partitioning is used for reducing the calculation of the density matrix into smaller subsystems rendering the calculation more computationally efficient. Unconstrained graph partitioning as community clustering based on the modularity metric can be naturally mapped into the Hamiltonian of the quantum annealer. On the other hand, when constraints are imposed for partitioning into equal parts and minimizing the number of cut edges between parts, a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) reformulation is required. This reformulation may employ the graph complement to fit the problem in the Chimera graph of the quantum annealer. Partitioning into 2 parts and k parts concurrently for arbitrary k are demonstrated with benchmark graphs, random graphs, and small material system density matrix based graphs. Results for graph partitioning using quantum and hybrid classical-quantum approaches are shown to be comparable to current \"state of the art\" methods and sometimes better.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Hayato  Ushijima-Mwesigwa", "Christian F.

For computational tractability in real large-scale settings, such plans are typically computed by solving deterministic and cyclic formulations. An important input is the periodic demand, i.e., the demand that is expected to repeat in each period of the planning horizon. Motivated by the discrepancy between time series forecasts of demand in each period and the periodic demand, Laage et al. (2021) recently introduced the Periodic Demand Estimation (PDE) problem and showed that it has a high value. However, they made strong assumptions on the solution space so that the problem could be solved by enumeration. In this paper we significantly extend their work. We propose a new PDE formulation that relaxes the strong assumptions on the solution space. We solve large instances of this formulation with a two-step heuristic. The first step reduces the dimension of the feasible space by performing clustering of commodities based on instance-specific information about demand and supply interactions. The formulation along with the first step allow to solve the problem in a second step by either metaheuristics or the state-of-the-art blackbox optimization solver NOMAD.

Images are displayed on designated monitors that cannot be positioned optimally due to sterility and spatial constraints.

The system streams high-resolution medical images from any modality to the head-mounted display in real-time that are blended with the surgical site. It allows for mixed reality visualization of images in head-, world-, or body-anchored mode and can thus be adapted to specific procedural needs. Results: For typical image sizes, the proposed system exhibits an average end-to-end delay and refresh rate of 214 +- 30 ms and 41:4 +- 32:0 Hz, respectively.

All emotions and thoughts are an emergent property of the chemical and electrical activity of neurons.

Researchers usually consider that only the instant of occurrence (timestamp) of these spikes encodes information. Registering neural activity evoked by stimuli demands timing determinism and data storage capabilities that cannot be met without dedicated hardware and a hard real-time operational system (RTOS). Indeed, research in neuroscience usually requires dedicated electronic instrumentation for studies in neural coding, brain machine interfaces and closed loop in vivo or in vitro experiments.

By securing carefully selected meter measurements, no false data injection attack can be launched to compromise any set of state variables. We characterize the optimal protection problem, which protects the state variables with minimum number of measurements, as a variant Steiner tree problem in a graph.

Recorded Sentinel-1 data have shown a potential for remotely observing and monitoring local conditions on broad acre fields. Remote sensing using Sentinel-1 have the potential to provide daily updates on the current conditions in the individual fields and at the same time give an overview of the agricultural areas in the region. Research depends on the ability of independent validation of the presented results. In the case of the Sentinel-1 satellites, every researcher has access to the same base dataset, and therefore independent validation is possible. Well documented research performed with Sentinel-1 allow other research the ability to redo the experiments and either validate or falsify presented findings. Based on current state-of-art research we have chosen to provide a service for researchers in the agricultural domain. The service allows researchers the ability to monitor local conditions by using the Sentinel-1 information combined with a priori knowledge from broad acre fields.

Furthermore, for embedded systems, low power consumption should be generally considered together with high computing performance. FPGAs, as programmable logic devices able to support different types of fine-grained parallelisms, their power and performance advantages were recognized widely. However, designing applications on FPGA-based systems is traditionally far from a task can be carried out by software programmers. Generally, hardware engineers and even system-level software engineers have more hardware/architectural knowledge but fewer algorithm and application knowledge. Thus, it is critical for computing systems to allow application-level programmers to realize their idea conveniently, which is popular in computing systems based on the general processor. In this paper, the OpenHEC (Open Framework for High-Efficiency Computing) framework is proposed to provide a design framework for application-level software programmers to use FPGA-based platforms.

These evolutions, combined with High Speed Machining (HSM) process of forging die lead to important increase in time for machining preparation. In this context, an original approach for generating machining process based on machining knowledge is proposed in this paper. The core of this approach is to decompose a CAD model of complex forging die in geometrical features. Technological data and topological relations are aggregated to a geometrical feature in order to create machining features. Technological data, such as material, surface roughness and form tolerance are defined during forging process and dies design. These data are used to choose cutting tools and machining strategies. Topological relations define relative positions between the surfaces of the die CAD model. After machining features identification cutting tools and machining strategies currently used in HSM of forging die, are associated to them in order to generate machining sequences. A machining process model is proposed to formalize the links between information imbedded in the machining features and the parameters of cutting tools and machining strategies. At last machining sequences are grouped and ordered to generate the complete die machining process. In this paper the identification of geometrical features is detailed. Geometrical features identification is based on machining knowledge formalization which is translated in the generation of maps from STL models. A map based on the contact area between cutting tools and die shape gives basic geometrical features which are connected or not according to the continuity maps. The proposed approach is illustrated by an application on an industrial study case which was accomplished as part of collaboration.", "venue": "Comput. Ind.

We designed a strategy to beat football bookmakers with their own numbers. Instead of building a forecasting model to compete with bookmakers predictions, we exploited the probability information implicit in the odds publicly available in the marketplace to find bets with mispriced odds.

The monitoring results are further processed for visualization purpose in the servers and the computed results are pushed to connected clients like browsers or mobile applications in real-time.

Visual Display Units, capable of displaying video data at High Definition and Ultra HD display resolutions, are frequently utilized on a global scale. Video compression artifacts that are present due to high levels of quantization, which are typically inconspicuous in low display resolution environments, are clearly visible on HD and UHD video data and VDUs. The default QM technique in HEVC does not take into account the video data resolution, nor does it take into consideration the associated display resolution of a VDU to determine the appropriate levels of quantization required to reduce unwanted video compression artifacts. Based on this fact, we propose a novel, adaptive quantization matrix technique for the HEVC standard, including Scalable HEVC. Our technique, which is based on a refinement of the current HVS-CSF QM approach in HEVC, takes into consideration the display resolution of the target VDU for the purpose of minimizing video compression artifacts.

Original equipment manufacturers of passenger vehicles hold secret their mappings of CAN data to vehicle signals, and these definitions vary according to make, model, and year. Without these mappings, the wealth of real-time vehicle information hidden in the CAN packets is uninterpretable, severely impeding vehicle-related research, including CAN cybersecurity and privacy studies, aftermarket tuning, efficiency and performance monitoring, and fault diagnosis to name a few. Guided by the four-part CAN signal definition, we present CAN-D (CAN-Decoder), a modular, four-step pipeline for identifying each signal's boundaries (start bit and length), endianness (byte ordering), signedness (bit-to-integer encoding), and by leveraging diagnostic standards, augmenting a subset of the extracted signals with meaningful, physical interpretation. En route to CAN-D, we provide a comprehensive review of the CAN signal reverse engineering research. All previous methods ignore endianness and signedness, rendering them incapable of decoding many standard CAN signal definitions. Incorporating endianness grows the search space from 128 to 4.72E21 signal tokenizations and introduces a web of changing dependencies. In response, we formulate, formally analyze, and provide an efficient solution to an optimization problem, allowing identification of the optimal set of signal boundaries and byte orderings. In addition, we provide two novel, state-of-the-art signal boundary classifiers\u2014both of which are superior to previous approaches in precision and recall in three different test scenarios\u2014and the first signedness classification algorithm, which exhibits a $>$ 97% F-score. Overall, CAN-D is the only solution with the potential to extract any CAN signal that is also the state of the art. In evaluation on 10 vehicles of different makes, CAN-D's average $\\ell ^1$ error is five times better (81% less) than all previous methods and exhibits lower average error, even when considering only signals that meet prior methods\u2019 assumptions.

In term of the maximum flow rate of the micro-pump is about 365 mul/min, when the applied voltage is 24 V and frequency 50 Hz. Photolithography process was used to fabricate the micro-pump mold. PDMS molding and PDMS bonding method were used to fabricate the micro-channel and actuator chambers. A portable drive controller was designed to control three PZT actuators in a proper sequence to drive the chamber membrane.

However, enhanced modeling and simulation require integration of various data and knowledge sources, models of various kinds (data-driven models, numerical models, simulation models, etc.), and intelligent components in one composite solution. Growing complexity of such composite model leads to the need of specific approaches for management of such model. This need extends where the model itself becomes a complex system. One of the important aspects of complex model management is dealing with the uncertainty of various kinds (context, parametric, structural, and input/output) to control the model. In the situation where a system being modeled, or modeling requirements change over time, specific methods and tools are needed to make modeling and application procedures (metamodeling operations) in an automatic manner. To support automatic building and management of complex models we propose a general evolutionary computation approach which enables managing of complexity and uncertainty of various kinds.

We propose a method to solve the nonlinear non-convex network localization problem with noisy distance measurements without any modification of constraints in the general model. We use the nonlinear Lagrangian technique for non-convex optimization to convert the problem to a root finding problem of a single variable continuous function. This problem is then solved using an iterative method. However, in each step of the iteration the computation of the functional value involves a finite mini-max problem (FMX).

Video segmentation based on motion [1] is a new research area. Motion is a salient feature in video, in addition to other typical image features such as color, shape and texture. Video shot boundary detection is a fundamental step in video indexing and retrieval, and in general video data management. The general objectives are to segment a given video sequence into its constituent shots, and to identify and classify the different shot transitions in the sequence [10]. Different algorithms have been proposed, for instance, based on simple color histograms [11, 12], pixel color differences [13], color ratio histograms [14], edges [15], and motion [16\u2013 18]. In this work, we study the problem of video partitioning using a motion-based approach. In this study we interest in the validation of the motion activity descriptor in the aim of its possible real time implementation. We have applied this descriptor for different video sequence. We have considered its application for shot boundary detection. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: in section 2, we present the motion activity descriptor specification.

However, there are high barriers for third parties in political elections. In this paper, we aim to address two questions: \"How well do the two major US parties represent the public's ideology?\" and \"Does a more-than-two-party system better represent the ideology of the public?\". To address these questions, we utilize the American National Election Studies Time series dataset, a dataset of opinion surveys of 20,502 individuals over multiple political issues since 1948. We perform unsupervised clustering with Gaussian Mixture Model method on this dataset, and we find the cluster center found under a two-cluster restriction is close to the party centers, which are estimated using the mean position of the individuals self-identified with the parties. We conclude that the major US parties are representative of the US population under the constraint that the political system is limited to two parties. We investigate if more than 2 parties represent the population better by comparing the Akaike Information Criteria for clustering results of various number of clusters. We find that additional clusters give better representation of the data, even after penalizing for the additional parameters.

In particular, we consider the problem of estimating the angular velocity of an object when only partial observation of its orientation is available. Interpolation schemes are proposed to overcome the discrete nature of observations and a practical numerical solution (particle filtering) is developed for filtering on the Stiefel manifold. The proposed solution to the filtering problem is based on the anti-development signal concept, which allows to overcome the non-additivity nature of the noise present in the observed signal. The solutions proposed are general and can be transposed to many manifolds. However, the presented examples and simulations consider the case of partially observed signals taking values on the special orthogonal group when one or more components are missing. In this particular case, the observed process takes its values in the Stiefel manifold. A comparison of the proposed particle filter with the extended Kalman filter is presented.

Three main concepts for 3D integration have been developed at IZM. The approach with the greatest flexibility called Inter Chip Via - Solid Liquid Interdiffusion (ICV-SLID) is introduced.

A first question thus arose as to the integration of indoor lighting conditions into the simulation, leading to a new model calculating natural and artificial lighting. The results of this new daylighting module were then compared with results of other simulation codes and experimental cases both in artificial and natural environments. Excellent agreements were obtained, such as the values for luminous efficiencies in a tropical and humid climate. In this paper, a comparison of the model output with detailed measures is presented using a dedicated test cell in Reunion Island (French overseas territory in the Indian Ocean), thus confirming the interest for thermal and daylighting designs in low-energy buildings. Introduction Several software packages are available for thermal and airflow simulation in buildings. The most frequently used are ENERGY+ [1], ESP-r [2], and TRNSYS [3]. These applications allow an increasing number of models to be integrated, such as airflow, pollutant transport, and daylighting. In the latter category, we may note ENERGY+, ESP-r and ECOTECT [4] software. After more than 20 years of developing a specific code named CODYRUN, we decided to add a lighting module to our software. This paper therefore provides some details on this evolution and elements of validation. The CODYRUN initial software and its validation Developed by the Physics and Mathematical Engineering Laboratory for Energy and Environment at the University of Reunion Island, CODYRUN [5-14] is a multi-zone software program integrating ventilation and moisture transport transfer in buildings. The software employs a zone approach based on nodal analysis and resolves a coupled system describing thermal and airflow phenomena. Numerous validation tests of the CODYRUN code were successfully applied to the software. Apart from the daylighting model, the majority applied the BESTEST procedure [15]. The International Energy Agency (IEA) sponsors a number of programs to improve the use and associated technologies of energy. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) developed BESTEST, which is a method based on comparative testing of building simulation programs, on the IEA's behalf. The procedure consists of a series of test cases buildings that are designed to isolate individual aspects of building energy and test the extremes of a program. As the modelling approach is very different between codes, the test cases are specified so that input equivalency can be defined thus allowing the different cases to be modelled by most of codes. The basis for comparison is a range of results from a number of programs considered to be a state-of-art in United States and Europe. Associated with other specific comparisons, a very confident level of validation was obtained for the CODYRUN initial software [8].", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Harry  Boyer", "St\u00e9phane  Guichard", "Aur\u00e9lien  Jean", "T.

Several algorithms for direct, iterative, and combinatorial-recursive calculations of multidimensional integral expressions, which can describe partial solutions of these problems, are presented (these solutions are further used to search for the common closed analytical regularities). The huge volume of necessary calculations forced us to formalize completely the algorithms and to transfer all the burden of routine analytical transforms to a computer. The calculations performed helped us to establish (and to prove later) a number of new earlier unknown probabilistic formulas responsible for random division of an interval. One more important feature of this study is the fact that we introduced a new concept of 'three-dimensional generalized Catalan numbers' and found their explicit form in solving problems associated with random division of an interval.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Aleksander  Reznik", "Vitaly  Efimov", "Aleksander  Soloview", "Andrey  Torgov"], "year": 2014, "n_citations": 0}

We discuss how the two aspects correspond respectively to elasticity and resilience and we highlight each aspect's qualities and limitations.

The current evolution of commercial off-the-shelf(COTS) processors facilitates the use of lower-precision arithmetic in ways that reduce energy consumption.

Furthermore, the increasing number of cores is placing a huge performance burden on the network-on-chip (NoC) infrastructure. While NoCs are designed as regular architectures that allow scaling to hundreds of cores, the lack of a flexible topology gives rise to higher latencies, lower throughput, and increased energy costs. In this paper, we explore MorphoNoCs - scalable, configurable, hybrid NoCs obtained by extending regular electrical networks with configurable nanophotonic links. In order to design MorphoNoCs, we first carry out a detailed study of the design space for Multi-Write Multi-Read (MWMR) nanophotonics links. After identifying optimum design points, we then discuss the router architecture for deploying them in hybrid electronic-photonic NoCs. We then study the design space at the network level, by varying the waveguide lengths and the number of hybrid routers. This affords us to carry out energy-latency trade-offs. For our evaluations, we adopt traces from synthetic benchmarks as well as the NAS Parallel Benchmark suite. Our results indicate that MorphoNoCs can achieve latency improvements of up to 3.0\u00d7 or energy improvements of up to 1.37\u00d7 over the base electronic network.", "venue": "Microprocess.

As a result, numerous network security technologies, methodologies, and policies have been developed to secure the business system. In comparison, process control systems, with their reliance on proprietary networks and hardware, have long been considered immune to cyber attacks. Now, with the move to open standards such as Ethernet, TCP/IP, and web technologies, the plant floor requires its own security procedures to eliminate undesirable access to production systems and to maximize the uptime and efficiency of process networks 1. Web-based Automated Process Control systems are a new type of applications that use the Internet to control industrial processes with the access to the real-time data. Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) networks contain computers and applications that perform key functions in providing essential services and commodities (e.g., electricity, natural gas, gasoline, water, waste treatment, transportation) to all Americans. As such, they are part of the nation's critical infrastructure and require protection from a variety of threats that exist in cyber space today. By allowing the collection and analysis of data and control of equipment such as pumps and valves from remote locations, SCADA networks provide great efficiency and are widely used 2. IEEE Standard 1402-2000, Guide for Electric Power Substation Physical and Electronic Security, states: \" The introduction of computer systems with online access to substation information is significant in that substation relay protection, control, and data collection systems may be exposed to the same vulnerabilities as all other computer systems.

However, it is important to successfully apply that knowledge to industrial networks. Figure 1. presents electronic intrusion vulnerabilities for industrial networks. Over the last 20 years, there were increasingly more complex, sophisticated, and capable control systems installed. These have included more sophisticated basic and advanced regulatory control, advanced process control, optimizers, and artificial intelligence 3.

It may otherwise lead to many iterations and thus impact time-to-market. This has encouraged to devise a feedback mechanism from a lower abstraction level of the design flow towards the higher levels. Some of these efforts include placement driven synthesis, routability (timing) driven placement etc. Motivated by this philosophy, we propose a novel global routing method using monotone staircase routing regions (channels), defined at the floorplanning stage. The intent is to identify the feasibility of a floorplan topology of the given design netlist by estimating routability, routed net length and the number of vias while taking into account global congestion scenario across the layout. This framework works on both unreserved as well as HV reserved layer model for $M(\\geq 2)$ metal layers and accommodates different capacity profiles of the routing resources, due to uniform or different cases of metal pitch variation across the metals layers akin to the latest technologies. This algorithm takes $O(n^2kt)$ time for a given design with $n$ blocks and $k$ nets having at most $t$ terminals. Experimental results on MCNC/GSRC floorplanning benchmarks show $100\\%$ routability while congestion in the routing regions restricted to $100\\%$. The routed net length for all $t$-terminal ($t\\geq$ 2) nets is comparable with the steiner length computed by FLUTE. An estimation on the number of vias for different capacity profiles are also obtained.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Bapi  Kar", "Susmita  Sur-Kolay", "Chittaranjan A.

However, if we go for a walk and have a look at the old part of any city, we will realize that still most of the buildings have a wood structure. In spite of the fact that the majority of urban regulations forbid their demolition, other bad practices such as casting and overloading the wood structure are very common. Considering that we want to reach a standard of sustainable construction, the economical and environmental costs, which are implied by the deficient refurbishment makes it well worth a previous study of the structure, which in most cases represents less than a 1% of the total budget. The main goal of this paper is to present most relevant parts of the whole process of diagnosis of a wood structure building by means of Non-Destructive Testing Techniques. Among the ones to be considered, we could mention the analysis of the building and its surroundings, on-site inspection of the building, structural diagnosis, definition of the corrective actions to be taken, definition of treatments, quality control and a maintenance plan. For the on-site inspection of the building, in the paper we will highlight the use of Non-Destructive methods such as resistograph drilling, X-ray imaging, ultrasound-based testing or moisture measurement.

The aim of this work was to determine the optimal microcoil design configuration for magnetic field generation. The results were applied to magnetic actuation, taking into account technological constraints. In particular, we have considered different realistic configurations that involve a magnetically actuated device coupled to a microcoil. Calculations by a semi-analytical method using Matlab software were validated by experimental measurements. The copper planar microcoils are fabricated by UV micromoulding on different substrates: flexible polymer (Kapton\u00ae) and silicate on silicon. They are constituted by a spiral-like continuous track. Their total surface is about 1\u00a0mm2.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Johan  Moulin", "Marion  Woytasik", "Emile  Martincic", "Elisabeth  Dufour-Gergam"], "year": 2008, "n_citations": 10}

The loss of sub channel orthogonality leads to inter-carrier interference (ICI). Using many algorithms for channel estimation, we will show that, for a 16- QAM modulation, the LMMSE algorithm performs well to achieve this estimation but when the SNR (Signal Noise Rate) is high, the four algorithms (LS, MMSE, LMMSE and Lr-LMMSE) perform similarly, this is not always the case for another scheme of modulation. We will improve also the mean squared error for these algorithms.

The low-frequency pulsating torque due to decrementation of flux is compensated in a feed forward manner.

Existing solutions do not make full use of trajectory planning of nearby vehicles, or social attributes. The development of onboard navigation system provides drivers some traveling route information. The main novelty of our approach is to envision sharing partial traveling information to the encountered vehicles for better service. Our data forwarding algorithm utilizes this lightweight information under the delusive paths privacy preservation together with the social community structure in vehicular networks. We assume that data transmission is carried by vehicles and road side units (RSUs), while cellular network manages and coordinates relevant global information. The approximate destination set is the set of RSUs that are often passed by the destination vehicle. RSU importance is raised by summing encounter ratios of RSUs in the same connected component. We first define a concept of space-time approachability which is derived from shared partial traveling route and encounter information. It describes the capability of a vehicle to advance messages toward destination. Then, we design a novel data forwarding algorithm, called approachability based algorithm, which combines the space-time approachability with the social community attribute in vehicular networks. We evaluate our approachability based algorithm on data sets from San Francisco Cabspotting and Shanghai Taxi Movement. Results show that the partially shared traveling information plays a positive role in data forwarding in vehicular networks.

First, we present a utilization-based schedulability test for such systems under EDF-VD scheduling. Second, we quantify the suboptimality of EDF-VD (with our test condition) in terms of speedup factors. In general, the speedup factor is a function with respect to the ratio between the amount of resource required by different types of tasks in different criticality modes, and reaches 4/3 in the worst case. Furthermore, we show that the proposed utilization-based schedulability test and speedup factor results apply to the elastic mixed-criticality model as well.

The significance of low temperature hot embossing is to improve global flatness of embossed devices. This paper reports on experimental studies of polymer deformation and relaxation in micro embossing when the process temperatures are below or near its glass transition temperature (Tg). In this investigation, an indentation system and a micro embosser were used to investigate the relationship of microstructure formation versus process temperature and load pressure. The depth of indentation was controlled and the load force at a certain indentation depth was measured. Experiments were carried out using 1 mm thick PMMA films with the process temperature ranging from Tg-55 degrees C to Tg +20 degrees C. The embossed structures included a single micro cavity and groups of micro cavity arrays. It was found that at temperature of Tg-55 degrees C, elastic deformation dominated the formation of microstructures and significant relaxation happened after embossing. From Tg-20 degrees C to Tg, plastic deformation dominated polymer deformation, and permanent cavities could be formed on PMMA substrates without obvious relaxation. However, the formation of protrusive structures as micro pillars was not complete since there was little polymer flow. With an increase in process temperature, microstructure could be formed under lower loading pressure. Considering the fidelity of a single microstructure and global flatness of embossed substrates, micro hot embossing at a low process temperature, but with good fidelity, should be preferred.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Xuechuan  Shan", "Y.

Coal blending represents a challenging and complex problem with numerous blending possibilities, multiple constraints and competing objectives. At many mine sites, blending decisions are made using heuristics that have been developed through experience or made by using computer assisted control algorithms or linear programming. While current blending procedures have achieved profitable outcomes in the past, they often result in a sub-optimal utilization of high quality coal. This sub-optimality has a considerable negative impact on mine site productivity as it can reduce the amount of lower quality ROM that is blended and sold. This article reviews the coal blending problem and discusses some of the difficult trade-offs and challenges that arise in trying to address this problem. We highlight some of the risks from making simplifying assumptions and the limitations of current software optimization systems.

System identification, which refers to estimation of process parameters, is a necessity in control theory. Real processes are usually of fractional order as opposed to the ideal integral order models. A simple and elegant scheme of estimating the parameters for such a fractional order process is proposed. This method employs fractional calculus theory to find equations relating the parameters that are to be estimated, and then estimates the process parameters after solving the simultaneous equations. The said simultaneous equations are generated and updated using particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique, the fitness function being the sum of squared deviations from the actual set of observations.

This paper describes the implementation and the evaluation of a wireless body sensor system that monitors human physiological data at home. Specifically, a waist-mounted triaxial accelerometer unit is used to record human movements. Sampled data are transmitted using an IEEE 802.15.4 wireless transceiver to a data logger unit. The wearable sensor unit is light, small, and consumes low energy, which allows for inexpensive and unobtrusive monitoring during normal daily activities at home. The acceleration measurement tests show that it is possible to classify different human motion through the acceleration reading. The 802.15.4 wireless signal quality is also tested in typical home scenarios. Measurement results show that even with interference from nearby IEEE 802.11 signals and microwave ovens, the data delivery performance is satisfactory and can be improved by selecting an appropriate channel. Moreover, we found that the wireless signal can be attenuated by housing materials, home appliances, and even plants. Therefore, the deployment of wireless body sensor systems at home needs to take all these factors into consideration.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Chao  Chen", "Carlos A.

However, the design approach of SoC-FPGA applications still follows traditional hardware-software separate workflow, which becomes the barrier of rapid product design and iteration on SoC-FPGA. High-Level Synthesis (HLS) and OpenCL-based system-level design approaches provide programmers the possibility to design SoC-FGPA at system-level with an unified development environment for both hardware and software. To evaluate the feasibility of high-level design approach especially for embedded vision applications, Vivado HLS and Altera SDK for OpenCL, representative and most popular commercial tools in market, are selected as evaluation design tools, disparity map calculation as targeting application. In this paper, hardware accelerators of disparity map calculation are designed with both tools and implemented on Zedboard and SoCKit development board, respectively. Comparisons between design tools are made in aspects of supporting directives, accelerator design process, and generated hardware performance. The results show that both tools can generate efficient hardware for disparity map calculation application with much less developing time. Moreover, we can also state that, more directives (e.g., interface type, array reshape, resource type specification) are supported, but more hardware knowledge is required, in Vivado HLS. In contrast, Altera SDK for OpenCL is relatively easier for software programmers who is new to hardware, but with the price of more resources usage on FPGA for similar hardware accelerator generation.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Shaodong  Qin", "Mladen  Berekovic"], "year": 2015, "n_citations": 6}

In the Table 1, truth table of conventional bit-by-bit majority vot ing for Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) was given to demonstrate output selection from redu ndant modules according to majority consensus. In this table, y1, y2 and y3 are output of modules and y represents voter output. General architecture of M-MR system was shown in th e Figure 1. In older studies, conventional majority voter was seen to capable of masking single errors which occurs when one of three modules is faulty. Table 1.

This is accomplished by transforming the user's trajectory path to a two-dimensional discrete time series curve that in turn transforms the stay-points to the local minima of the first derivative of this curve. \nTo demonstrate the soundness of the proposed method, we evaluated it on raw, noisy trajectory data acquired over the period of 28 different days using four different techniques.

Two recent trends in microgrids are the integration of local renewable energy sources (such as wind farms) and the use of co-generation (i.e., to supply both electricity and heat). However, these trends also bring unprecedented challenges to the design of intelligent control strategies for microgrids. Traditional generation scheduling paradigms rely on perfect prediction of future electricity supply and demand. They are no longer applicable to microgrids with unpredictable renewable energy supply and with co-generation (that needs to consider both electricity and heat demand). In this paper, we study online algorithms for the microgrid generation scheduling problem with intermittent renewable energy sources and co-generation, with the goal of maximizing the cost-savings with local generation. Based on the insights from the structure of the offline optimal solution, we propose a class of competitive online algorithms, called CHASE (Competitive Heuristic Algorithm for Scheduling Energy-generation), that track the offline optimal in an online fashion. Under typical settings, we show that CHASE achieves the best competitive ratio among all deterministic online algorithms, and the ratio is no larger than a small constant 3. We also extend our algorithms to intelligently leverage on limited prediction of the future, such as near-term demand or wind forecast. By extensive empirical evaluations using real-world traces, we show that our proposed algorithms can achieve near offline-optimal performance. In a representative scenario, CHASE leads to around 20% cost reduction with no future look-ahead, and the cost reduction increases with the future look-ahead window.", "venue": "SIGMETRICS '13", "authors": ["Lian  Lu", "Jinlong  Tu", "Chi-Kin  Chau", "Minghua  Chen", "Xiaojun  Lin"], "year": 2013, "n_citations": 107}

The use of the Unified Modeling Language (UML) as a model description language is also rapidly becoming a standard. All these concepts have relations to the HLA, but they are not part of it. There seems to be the danger that HLA is overrun by respective developments of the free market and will become irrelevant finally. A few years ago, another \"Green Elephant\" faced the same fate: The program language ADA was mandated to be used for military applications but became irrelevant for commercial applications. Underestimating the power of the free market - especially C++, Java, and the Internet protocols - ADA barely survived the wave of emerging technologies and tools. Today we might soon observe HLA fading into a similar insignificance if it doesn't continue to evolve. The good news is that a potential solution already is formulated. First, the shortcomings of HLA are known and respective methods and processes are already identified in the papers mentioned before. Second, only recently the Object Management Group (OMG) introduced the Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) initiave as an approach to system-specification and interoperability based on the use of formal models. The core of the MDA concepts comprises the UML, XML as well as the related XML Metadata Interchange (XMI) specification, SOAP and other OMG standards. The concepts are designed to embrace OMG middleware solutions, i.e., the Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA), as well as alternatives like Microsoft's Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM), Sun's Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) etc. In other words, the solutions being perceived outside the HLA are in fact part of MDA. Thus, in order to keep the HLA relevant, where feasible, the HLA and MDA must merge into a new interoperability solution that is not only accepted by the SISO community, but one that also benefits from the overall efforts of the OMG. This paper introduces the MDA concept and shows, how the HLA can be integrated to become a standard stub for simulation applications of legacy systems, systems under development, and systems of the future.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Andreas  Tolk"], "year": 2010, "n_citations": 41}

This note investigates the effect of adding directionality to the \"repositioning factor\" approach. As a general proposition, it appears that doing so does not improve convergence speed or accuracy.

The importance of the effects was demonstrated and quantified, showing that there is still space for developments in this field. However, as the problem becomes quadratic, there is a possibility that the current algorithms are not able to solve the problem to optimality. Thus, future improvements in the algorithms may further improve the results.

The modeling of the thermocouple and the thermopile has been performed analytically and numerically. An output power of about 1 \u00b5W at an output voltage of more than 1 V is expected from the current design of thermopiles in a watch-size generator. The key material properties of the poly-SiGe have been measured. The thermopile has been fabricated and tested. Experimental results clearly demonstrate the advantage of the rim structure in increasing output voltage. In presence of forced convection, the output voltage of a non-released thermopile can increase from about 53 mV/K/cm2 to about 130 mV/K/cm2 after the rim structure is formed.

Although optimal feedback scheduling schemes are in principle capable of maximizing the overall control performance of multitasking control systems, most of them induce excessively large computational overheads associated with the mathematical optimization routines involved and hence are not directly applicable to practical systems. To optimize the overall control performance while minimizing the overhead of feedback scheduling, this paper proposes an efficient feedback scheduling scheme based on feedforward neural networks. Using the optimal solutions obtained offline by mathematical optimization methods, a back-propagation (BP) neural network is designed to adapt online the sampling periods of concurrent control tasks with respect to changes in computing resource availability.

However, STT-MRAMs suffer from poor reliability due to shared read and write paths. Additionally, conflicting requirements for data retention and writeability (both related to the energy barrier height of the storage device) makes design more challenging. Furthermore, the energy barrier height depends on the geometry of the storage. Any variations in the geometry of the storage device lead to variations in the energy barrier height. In order to address the poor reliability of STT-MRAMs, usage of Error Correcting Codes (ECC) has been proposed. Unlike traditional CMOS memory technologies, ECC is expected to correct both soft and hard errors in STT-MRAMs. To achieve acceptable yield with low write power, stronger ECC is required, resulting in increased number of encoded bits and degraded memory capacity. In this article, we propose Failure-aware ECC (FaECC), which masks permanent faults while maintaining the same correction capability for soft errors without increased number of encoded bits. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of process variations on run-time reliability of STT-MRAMs. In order to analyze the effectiveness of our methodology, we developed a cross-layer simulation framework that consists of device, circuit and array level analysis of STT-MRAM memory arrays. Our results show that using FaECC relaxes the requirements on the energy barrier height, which reduces the write energy and results in smaller access transistor size and memory array area.", "venue": "ACM J.

The EE is evaluated by the total energy consumption for transmitting per message bit. Three channel cases are considered, namely static channel with channel state information available at transmitter (CSIT), fast-varying (FV) channel with channel distribution information available at transmitter (CDIT), and FV channel with CSIT. The link's circuit power is modeled as \u03c1+\u03ba\u03c6(R) Watt, where \u03c1>0 and \u03ba\u22650 are two constants and \u03c6(R) is a general increasing and convex function of the transmission rate R\u22650. For all the three channel cases, the tradeoff between the EE and SE is studied. It is shown that the EE improves strictly as the SE increases from 0 to the optimum SE, and then strictly degrades as the SE increases beyond the optimum SE. The impact of \u03ba, \u03c1 and other system parameters on the optimum EE and corresponding SE is investigated to obtain insight. Some of the important and interesting results for all the channel cases include: (1) when \u03ba increases the SE corresponding to the optimum EE should keep unchanged if \u03c6(R)=R, but reduced if \u03c6(R) is strictly convex of R; (2) when the rate-independent circuit power \u03c1 increases, the SE corresponding to the optimum EE has to be increased. A polynomial-complexity algorithm is developed with the bisection method to find the optimum SE. The insight is corroborated and the optimum EE for the three cases are compared by simulation results.", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Communications", "authors": ["Tao  Wang", "Luc  Vandendorpe"], "year": 2013, "n_citations": 33}

Resource-aware execution takes into account the resource status when executing tasks on MPSoCs. Exploration of resource-aware computing at early design stages of complex systems is mandatory and appropriate methodologies to do this in an efficient manner are thus required. In this paper, we present a modular approach which provides modeling and simulation support for investigation of resource-aware execution in MPSoCs.

Because of inherent differences between internal infrastructures, the systems deployed in developed countries may not be amenable to developing ones. Besides, the traffic systems of developing countries are not well-studied in the literature to the best of our knowledge. For example, it is yet to explore how a developed country's lane-based traffic flow would perform in the context of a developing country, which generally experiences non-lane-based traffic. As such, by using our newly developed traffic simulator 'RoadBird', we investigate outcomes of both lane-based and non-lane-based traffic from the contexts of both developing and developed countries. To do so, we run simulations over real road topologies (extracted from the GIS maps of major cities such as Dhaka, Miami, and Riyadh) considering different scenarios such as lane-based or non-lane-based flows, homogeneous or heterogeneous traffic, with or without pedestrians, etc. We also incorporate different car-following and lane-changing models to mimic traffic behaviors and investigate their performances. While the lane changing dilemma remains an open research question, our experimental evidences indicate: (i) lane-based approaches will not necessarily perform better in the case of currently-adopted non-lane-based scenarios; and (ii) non-lane-based strategies may benefit system performance in lane-based scenarios while having heavy mixed traffic.

This trend impacts not only the design of computer architectures, but also the design of programs. However, developers still lack affordable and accurate technology to measure energy consumption in computing systems. The goal of this paper is to mitigate such problem. To this end, we introduce JetsonLEAP, a framework that supports the implementation of energy-aware programs. JetsonLEAP consists of an embedded hardware, in our case, the NVIDIA Jetson TK1 development board, a circuit to control the flow of energy, of our own design, plus a library to instrument program parts. We discuss two different circuit setups. The most precise setup lets us reliably measure the energy spent by 225,000 instructions, the least precise, although more affordable setup, gives us a window of 975,000 instructions. To probe the precision of our system, we use it in tandem with a high-precision, high-cost acquisition system, and show that results do not differ in any significant way from those that we get using our simpler apparatus. Our entire infrastructure \u2013 board, power meter and both circuits \u2013 can be reproduced with about $500.00.

However, these algorithms are commonly compared against weak baselines, which may contribute to excessive optimism. To assess how well an algorithm works, scientists typically ask how well its output correlates with medically assigned scores. Here we perform a meta-analysis to quantify how the literature evaluates their algorithms for monitoring mental wellbeing. We find that the bulk of the literature (\u223c77%) uses meaningless comparisons that ignore patient baseline state. For example, having an algorithm that uses phone data to diagnose mood disorders would be useful. However, it is possible to explain over 80% of the variance of some mood measures in the population by simply guessing that each patient has their own average mood\u2014the patient-specific baseline. Thus, an algorithm that just predicts that our mood is like it usually is can explain the majority of variance, but is, obviously, entirely useless.

In this paper, we present a staff preference optimization framework which is solved with a greedy double swap heuristic. The heuristic yields good performance in speed at solving the problem. The heuristic is simple and we will demonstrate its performance by implementing it on open source spreadsheet software.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Murphy  Choy", "Michelle L. F.

For evaluation of this code, the results of a photoelastic experience of a sample contact problembetween a half-plane with an oblique edge crack and a tilted wedge using this image processing method was compared with theFEM results of the same problem in order to obtain the stress intensity factors (SIF) of the specimen. A good agreement betweenexperimental results extracted from this method of image processing and computational results was observed.Keywords: Image processing; Photoelastic fringe patterns;Sharpening; Stress intensity factors 1. IntroductionA practical technique to experimentally obtainstress distribution in transparent materials isphotoelasticity. However, in the photoelasticexperiments, the exact path of isochromatic fringes inimages captured by professional cameras can be hardlydetected by bare eyes, and this problem usually causesconsiderable errors in final image analysis. Moreover,the exact locations of fringe pixels are require in thefracture mechanics equations for calculation stressintensity factors of materials, and as theory ofphotoelasticity says an isochromatic fringe should be aline without width for which the stress-optic law is true.One of the effective methods of eliminatingthe errors occurred in determination of pixels located onan isochromatic fringe is image processing. Up to now,many researches have been done to develop an imageprocessing method for photoelastic fringe patternanalysis. In 1990, Wang Wei-Chung developed analgorithm on a digital photoelastic system for extractingstress intensity factor from the experimentally obtainedphotoelastic fringe pattern [1]. In the following year,A.C. Gillies worked on a low-level image-processingalgorithm for photoelastic fringe pattern analysis [2].Then in 1994, J. Carazo-Alvarez et al combined twoautomated systems of photoelastic analysis to identifythe absolute value of the isochromatic parameter at apoint with minor errors than previous techniques [3].Later in 1998, S Yoneyama et al presented newmethods of photoelastic fringe analysis from a singleimage [4-5]. Afterwards, many other researchers likeT.Y. Chen et al [6] and C.W. Chang et al [7-8] utilizeddigital image processing to determine stress distributionin some practical mechanical problems.This study presented a type of imageprocessing code in which the exact locations of pixelsin a fringe path can be detected. This code used asignificant property of all the pixels that belong toisochromatic fringes. This communal property is theirextremum light intensity which is the basis of this typeof image processing algorithm.The image processing code was utilized inphotoelastic experimental analysis of a contact problembetween a tilted asymmetric wedge and an infinite halfplane containing an oblique edge crack to measure itsstress intensity factors. Then, FEM analysis of the sameproblem was carry out for verification of the algorithmoutcomes and evaluation of its effectiveness in reducingthe errors of experimental results.2. Image processing algorithmThe algorithm of this method of imageprocessing was coded in C-Sharp software. At the firststep of this algorithm, the image got divided into tinysegments.

Very Large Instruction Word (VLIW) processors provide a means to efficiently exploi t the instruction level parallelism (ILP) exhibited by a sign ificant segment of embedded applications.

However, traditional 2D architecture of driving circuits can not meet the requirement for high scanning speed and low data accessing points when nozzle numbers greater than 1000. This paper proposes a novel architecture of high-selection-speed three-dimensional data registration for inkjet applications. With the configuration of three-dimensional data registration, the number of data accessing points as well as the scanning lines can be greatly reduced for large array inkjet printheads with nozzles numbering more than 1000.

We proposed to realize a global optimization of a deep drawing industrial progression (made of several stages) for a cup manufacture. The objectives of the process were the thickness decrease and the geometrical parameters (especially the height). This paper improves on this previous work in the aim of mastering the contour error. From the optimal configuration, we expect to cut down the amount of the needed material and the number of forming operations. Our action is focused on the appearance of unexpected undulations (ears) located on the rim of the cups during forming due to a nonuniform crystallographic texture. Those undulations can cause a significant amount of scraps, productivity loss, and cost during manufacture. In this paper, this phenomenon causes the use of four forming operations for the cup manufacture. The aim is to cut down from four to two forming stages by defining an optimal blank (size and shape). The advantage is to reduce the cost of the tool manufacturing and to minimize the needed material (by suppressing the part flange). The chosen approach consists in defining a particular description of the ears' part by modal decomposition and then simulating several blank shapes and sizes generated by discrete cosine transformation (DCT). The use of a numerical simulation for the forming operation and the design of an experiment technique allow mathematical links between the ears' formation and the DCT coefficients. An optimization is then possible by using mathematical links. This original approach leads the ears' amplitude to be reduced by a factor of 10, with only 15 numerical experiments. Moreover, we have limited the number of forming stages from 4 to 2 with a minimal material use.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Y.

That is, the problem of finding the possible causes, mechanistic origins, first principles, and generative models of a piece of data from a physical phenomenon. Here we explain how generating and exploring software space following the framework of Algorithmic Information Dynamics, it is possible to find small models and learn to navigate a sci-fi-looking space that can advance the field of scientific discovery with complementary tools to offer an opportunity to advance science itself. 1 Failure is at the Origin of Computer Science At the beginning of the twentieth century and through the end of the Second World War, computers were human, not electronic. The work of a computer consisted in solving tedious arithmetical operations with paper and pencil. This was looked upon as work of an inferior order. At an international mathematics conference in 1928, David Hilbert and Wilhelm Ackermann suggested the possibility that a mechanical process could be devised that would be capable of proving all mathematical assertions without need of human intervention, given the tedious and almost mundane nature of such a step-by-step undertaking without much human creativity involved. 1 ar X iv :2 10 9. 08 52 3v 1 [ cs .O H ] 1 5 Se p 20 21 This proposition is referred to as Entscheidungsproblem in German, or \u2018the decision problem\u2019 in English. If a human computer did no more than execute a mechanical process, it was not difficult to imagine that arithmetic would be amenable to a similar sort of mechanisation. The origin of Entscheidungsproblem dates back to Gottfried Leibniz, who having (around 1672) succeeded in building a machine based on the ideas of Blaise Pascal that was capable of performing arithmetical operations (named Staffelwalze or the Step Reckoner), imagined a machine of the same kind that would be capable of manipulating symbols to determine the truth value of mathematical principles. To this end Leibniz devoted himself to conceiving a formal universal language, which he designated characteristica universalis, a language that would encompass, among other things, binary language and the definition of binary arithmetic. In 1931, Kurt G\u00f6del [9] concluded that Hilbert\u2019s intention (also referred to as \u2018Hilbert\u2019s programme\u2019) of proving all theorems by mechanising mathematics was impossibe to realise -except in the case of trivial, constrained versions of mathematical frameworks since the body of mathematics needed to contain basic axioms such as those in arithmetic or set theory. G\u00f6del advanced formulas that codified arithmetical truths in arithmetical terms that could not be proved without arriving at a contradiction. Even worse, his formulas implied that there was no set of axioms that contained arithmetic free of unprovable true formulae, and that any extension to axioms would only lead to the same inconclusive statements in the theory. In 1944, Emil Post, another key figure in the development of the concepts of computation and computability (focusing especially on the limits of computation) found [17] that this problem was intimately related to one of the twentythree problems (the tenth) that Hilbert, speaking at the Sorbonne in Paris, had declared the most important challenges for twentieth century mathematics. Usually, Hilbert\u2019s programme is considered a failure, but not only it saved human creativity from full mechanisation but led to computation as a science by own virtue, perhaps even more than others that can be translated to finite or purely mechanistic procedures. Even though G\u00f6del debunked [9] the notion that what was true could be proved, presenting a negative solution to the \u2018decision problem\u2019 (Hilbert\u2019s tenth problem), followed by negative results based on G\u00f6del\u2019s [2, 3, 15]. 1.1 All for one machine, and one machine for all Not long after G\u00f6del, Alan M. Turing made his appearance. Turing contemplated the problem of decision in much cruder terms. If the act of performing arithmetical operations is mechanical, why not substitute a mechanical device for the human computer? Turing\u2019s work represented the first abstract description of the digital general-purpose computer as we know it today. Turing defined what in his article he termed an \u2018a\u2019 computer (for \u2018automatic\u2019), now known as a Turing machine. A Turing machine is an abstract device which reads or writes symbols on a tape one at a time, and can change its operation according to what it reads,", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Hector  Zenil"], "year": 2021, "n_citations": 0}

In general, product bundling and offering products to customers involves two main issues, namely identification of product taste according to demography and product evaluation and selection to increase sales. The former helps to identify, analyze and understand customer needs according to the demo-graphical characteristics and correspondingly transform them into a set of specifications and offerings for people. The latter, concerns with how to determine the best product strategy and offerings for the customer in helping the retail market to improve their sales. Existing research has focused only on identifying patterns for a particular dataset and for a particular setting. This work aims to develop an explicit decision support for the retailers to improve their product segmentation for different settings based on the people characteristics and thereby promoting sales by efficient knowledge discovery from the existing sales and product records. The work presents a framework, which models an association relation mapping between the customers and the clusters of products they purchase in an existing location and helps in finding rules for a new location. The methodology is based on the integration of popular data mining approaches such as clustering and association rule mining. It focuses on the discovery of rules that vary according to the economic and demographic characteristics and concentrates on marketing of products based on the population.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["D.

There are many challenges in adaptive computing and dynamic reconfigurable systems. One of the major understudied challenges is estimating the required resources in terms of soft cores, Programmable Reconfigurable Regions (PRRs), the appropriate communication infrastructure, and to predict a near optimal layout and floor-plan of the reconfigurable logic fabric. Some of these issues are specific to the application being designed, while others are more general and relate to the underlying run-time environment. Static resource allocation for Run-Time Reconfiguration (RTR) often leads to inferior and unacceptable results. In this paper, we present a novel adaptive and dynamic methodology, based on a Machine Learning approach, for predicting and estimating the necessary resources for an application based on past historical information. An important feature of the proposed methodology is that the system is able to learn and generalize and, therefore, is expected to improve its accuracy over time.\u00a0 The goal of the entire process is to extract useful hidden knowledge from the data.

What is usually the subject of science fiction is here proposed as a scientific theory open to empirical evaluation. We know from physics how the world behaves, and from computing how information behaves, so whether the physical world arises from ongoing information processing is a question science can evaluate. A prima facie case for the virtual reality conjecture is presented. If a photon is a pixel on a multi-dimensional grid that gives rise to space, the speed of light could reflect its refresh rate. If mass, charge and energy all arise from processing, the many conservation laws of physics could reduce to a single law of dynamic information conservation. If the universe is a virtual reality, then its big bang creation could be simply when the system was booted up.

The functionality of a programmable circuit can be altered by simply changing the angle values of the rotation gates in the circuit. Here, we present a new quantum circuit design technique resulting in two general programmable circuit schemes. The circuit schemes can be used to simulate any given operator by setting the angle values in the circuit. This provides a fixed circuit design whose angles are determined from the elements of the given matrix-which can be non-unitary-in an efficient way. We also give both the classical and quantum complexity analysis for these circuits and show that the circuits require a few classical computations. For the electronic structure simulation on a quantum computer, one has to perform the following steps: prepare the initial wave function of the system; present the evolution operator U = e(-iHt) for a given atomic and molecular Hamiltonian H in terms of quantum gates array and apply the phase estimation algorithm to find the energy eigenvalues. Thus, in the circuit model of quantum computing for quantum chemistry, a crucial step is presenting the evolution operator for the atomic and molecular Hamiltonians in terms of quantum gate arrays.

First, we apply, for the first time, a framework borrowed from economics to a problem in the smart grid namely, the design of signaling schemes between a consumer and an electricity aggregator when these have non-aligned objectives. The consumer's objective is to meet its need in terms of power and send a request (a message) to the aggregator which does not correspond, in general, to its actual need. The aggregator, which receives this request, not only wants to satisfy it but also wants to manage the cost induced by the residential electricity distribution network. Second, we establish connections between the exploited framework and the quantization problem. Although the model assumed for the payoff functions for the consumer and aggregator is quite simple, it allows one to extract insights of practical interest from the analysis conducted. This allows us to establish a direct connection with quantization, and more importantly, to open a much more general challenge for source and channel coding.", "venue": "2014 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)", "authors": ["Benjamin  Larrousse", "Olivier  Beaude", "Samson  Lasaulce"], "year": 2014, "n_citations": 20}

Numerical computations have accelerated significantly since 2005 thanks to two complementary, silicon-enabled trends: multi-core processing and single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) accelerators. Unfortunately, due to fundamental limitations of physics, these two trends could not be accompanied by a corresponding increase in memory, storage, and I/O bandwidth. High-performance computing (HPC) is the proverbial \u201ccanary in the coal mine\u201d of multi-core processing. When HPC hits a multi-core will likely encounter a similar limit in few years. We describe the computationally efficient (Fig 1b) and adaptive APplication AXceleration (APAX) numerical encoding method to reduce the memory wall for integers and floating-point operands. APAX achieves encoding rates between 3:1 and 10:1 without changing the dataset's statistical or spectral characteristics. APAX encoding takes advantage of three characteristics of all numerical sequences: peak-to-average ratio, oversampling, and effective number of bits (ENOB). Uncertainty quantification and spectral methods quantify the degree of uncertainty (accuracy) in numerical datasets. APAX profiler creates a rate-correlation graph with recommended operating signals, and fundamental limit, consumer point, provides 18 quantitative metrics comparing the original and decoded displays input and residual spectra with a residual histogram. On 24 integer and floating-point HPC datasets taken from climate, multi-physics, and seismic simulations, APAX averaged 7.95:1 encoding ratio at a Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0. 999948, and a spectral margin (input spectrum min - residual spectrum mean) of 24 dB.

It uses the instantaneous value of the square of the error signal as an estimate of the mean-square error (MSE). The LMS algorithm changes (adapts) the filter tap weights so that the error signal is minimized in the mean square sense. In Trigonometric LMS (TLMS) and Hyperbolic LMS (HLMS), two new versions of LMS algorithms, same formulations are performed as in the LMS algorithm with the exception that filter tap weights are now expressed using trigonometric and hyperbolic formulations, in cases for TLMS and HLMS respectively. Hence appears the CORDIC algorithm as it can efficiently perform trigonometric, hyperbolic, linear and logarithmic functions. While hardware-efficient algorithms often exist, the dominance of the software systems has kept those algorithms out of the spotlight. Among these hardware- efficient algorithms, CORDIC is an iterative solution for trigonometric and other transcendental functions. Former researches worked on CORDIC algorithm to observe the convergence behavior of Trigonometric LMS (TLMS) algorithm and obtained a satisfactory result in the context of convergence performance of TLMS algorithm. But revious researches directly used the CORDIC block output in their simulation ignoring the internal step-by-step rotations of the CORDIC processor. This gives rise to a need for verification of the convergence performance of the TLMS algorithm to investigate if it actually performs satisfactorily if implemented with step-by-step CORDIC rotation. This research work has done this job. It focuses on the internal operations of the CORDIC hardware, implements the Trigonometric LMS (TLMS) and Hyperbolic LMS (HLMS) algorithms using actual CORDIC rotations.

Because some departing flights are held at gates, there is a possibility that arriving flights cannot access the gates and have to wait until the gates are cleared. This is called a gate conflict. Robust gate assignment is an assignment that minimizes gate conflicts by assigning gates to aircraft to maximize the time gap between two consecutive flights at the same gate; it makes gate assignment robust, but passengers may walk longer to transfer flights. In order to simulate the airport departure process, a queuing model is introduced. The model is calibrated and validated with actual data from New York La Guardia Airport (LGA). Then, the model simulates the airport departure process with the original gate assignment and a robust gate assignment to assess the impact of gate assignment on gate-holding departure control. The results show that the robust gate assignment reduces the number of gate conflicts caused by gate holding compared to the original gate assignment. Therefore, robust gate assignment can be combined with gate-holding departure control to improve operations at congested airports with limited gate resources.", "venue": "2012 IEEE/AIAA 31st Digital Avionics Systems Conference (DASC)", "authors": ["Sang Hyun Kim", "Eric  Feron"], "year": 2012, "n_citations": 11}

In particular, we target photovoltaic panels with small form factors, as those exploited by embedded communication devices such as wireless sensor nodes or, concerning modern cellular system technology, by small-cells. Our models are especially useful for the theoretical investigation and the simulation of energetically self-sufficient communication systems that include these devices.The Markov models that we derive in this paper are obtained from extensive solar radiation databases, that are widely available online. Basically, from hourly radiance patterns, we derive the corresponding amount of energy (current and voltage) that is accumulated over time, and we finally use it to represent the scavenged energy in terms of its relevant statistics. Toward this end, two clustering approaches for the raw radiance data are described and the resulting Markov models are compared against the empirical distributions. Our results indicate that Markov models with just two states provide a rough characterization of the real data traces. While these could be sufficiently accurate for certain applications, slightly increasing the number of states to, e.g., eight, allows the representation of the real energy inflow process with an excellent level of accuracy in terms of first and second order statistics.

However, not all the information contained in a pair of continuous trajectories is important and thus the need for qualitative descriptions of interaction trajectories arises. The Qualitative Trajectory Calculus (QTC) (Van de Weghe, 2004) is a promising development towards this goal. Numerous variants of QTC have been proposed in the past and QTC has been applied towards analyzing various interaction domains. However, an inherent limitation of those QTC variations that deal with lateral movements is that they are limited to two-dimensional motion; therefore, complex three-dimensional interactions, such as those occurring between flying planes or birds, cannot be captured. Towards that purpose, in this paper QTC3D is presented: a novel qualitative trajectory calculus that can deal with full three-dimensional interactions. QTC3D is based on transformations of the Frenet\u2013Serret frames accompanying the trajectories of the moving objects. Apart from the theoretical exposition, including definition and properties, as well as computational aspects, we also present an application of QTC3D towards modeling bird flight. Thus, the power of QTC is now extended to the full dimensionality of physical space, enabling succinct yet rich representations of spatial interactions between agents.", "venue": "Inf.

However, the universe (uniform superposition) will be zero with high probability (non-zero with exponentially low probability) in the random-telegraph-wave representation thus the operations with the universe would require exponential time-complexity. To fix this deficiency, we modify the amplitudes of the signals of the L and H states and achieve an exponential speedup compared to the old situation. Another improvement concerns the identification of a single product (hyperspace) state. We introduce a time shifted noise-based logic, which is constructed by shifting each reference signal with a small time delay. This modification implies an exponential speedup of single hyperspace vector identification compared to the former case and it requires the same, O(N) complexity as in quantum computing.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["He  Wen", "Laszlo B.

Composition-order invariance explicitly captures a common property that is implicit in any context where one can draw a figure (hiding the drawing order) of several connected systems, which appears in many scientific contexts. This abstract algebra captures settings where one is interested in the behavior of a composed system in an environment and wants to abstract away anything internal not relevant for the behavior. This may include physical systems, electronic circuits, or interacting distributed systems. One specific such setting, of special interest in computer science, are functional system algebras, which capture, in the most general sense, any type of system that takes inputs and produces outputs depending on the inputs, and where the output of a system can be the input to another system. The behavior of such a system is uniquely determined by the function mapping inputs to outputs. We consider several instantiations of this very general concept. In particular, we show that Kahn networks form a functional system algebra and prove their composition-order invariance. Moreover, we define a functional system algebra of causal systems, characterized by the property that inputs can only influence future outputs, where an abstract partial order relation captures the notion of \u201clater\u201d.

Next, the properties of the spontaneous process of collecting purposeful information are investigated. In effect, the properties of this process: the goal 'continuation of existence', reproduction and Darwinian mechanism are derived which suggest, that it is the natural life process. A 'natural identity criterion' appears in this process for an evolving object, that is connected to a 'small change tendency'. Likewise, 'hereditary information' is defined. Artificial life is constructed by living objects, is a part of natural life process and its properties are not an effect of its internal restrictions but of external assumptions.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Andrzej  Gecow"], "year": 2010, "n_citations": 4}

Consequently, airport ground operations face critically congested taxiways and long runway queues. In this report, we show how improved management of departure operations from the ready-to-push-back time to the wheels-off time can potentially yield significant benefits to airlines and air traffic services. We develop a Collaborative Virtual Queue to enable better optimization capabilities during congested situations while taking into account the laissez-faire competitive environment. Results are evaluated using a departure system model, validated using current statistics and previous studies. First, the Collaborative Virtual Queue enables keeping aircraft away from runway queues, which increases wheels-off time predictability. Second, holding aircraft enables last-minute intra-airline flight switching. This creates new optimization capabilities for airlines i.e. it gives airlines the flexibility to prioritize their flight sequence in real-time. These capabilities are illustrated by the trade-off between minimizing the average passenger waiting time and minimizing the level of unfairness between aircraft of the same airline. For instance, airlines could choose to decrease by up to 15% their average passenger waiting time by prioritizing heavy planes over small planes when the taxiway system is congested.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Pierrick  Burgain", "Eric  Feron", "John-Paul  Clarke"], "year": 2008, "n_citations": 22}

However, its computational complexity grows linearly with the number of measurements and particles assigned to each target, and this can be very time consuming especially when numerous targets and clutter exist in the surveillance region. Addressing this issue, we present a distributed computation particle PHD filter for target tracking. Its framework consists of several local particle PHD filters at each processing element and a central unit. Each processing element takes responsibility for part particles but full measurements and provides local estimates; central unit controls particle exchange between processing elements and specifies a fusion rule to match and fuse the estimates from different local filters. The proposed framework is suitable for parallel implementation and maintains the tracking accuracy. Simulations verify the proposed method can provide comparative accuracy as well as a significant speedup with the standard particle PHD filter.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Junjie  Wang", "Lingling  Zhao", "Xiaohong  Su", "Peijun  Ma"], "year": 2015, "n_citations": 0}

All components in the air traffic system are connected to form an interactive network. So, a disturbance that occurs in one component, for example, a severe delay at an airport, can influence the entire network. Delays are easily propagated between flights through gates, but the propagation can be reduced if gate assignments are robust against stochastic delays. In this paper, we analyze gate delays and suggest an approach that involves assigning gates while making them robust against stochastic delays. We extract an example flight schedule from data source and generate schedules with increased traffic to analyze how the compact flight schedules impact the robustness of gate assignment. Simulation results show that our approach improves the robustness of gate assignment. Particularly, the robust gate assignment reduces average duration of gate conflicts by 96.3% and the number of gate conflicts by 96.7% compared to the baseline assignment. However, the robust gate assignment results in longer transit time for passengers, and a trade-off between the robustness of gate assignment and passenger transit time is presented.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Sang Hyun Kim", "Eric  Feron"], "year": 2013, "n_citations": 3}

Noticeably, a trend is those service providers are trying to reduce their carbon emissions by utilizing on-site or off-site renewable energy in their datacenters in order to attract more customers. With such efforts have been paid, there are still some users who are aggressively calling for even cleaner Internet services. For example, over 500,000 Facebook users petitioned the social networking site to use renewable energy to power its datacenter. However, it seems impossible for such demand to be satisfied merely from the inside of those production datacenters, considering the transition cost and stability. Outside the existing Internet services, on the other hand, may easily set up a proxy service to attract those renewable-energy-sensitive users, by 1) using carbon neutral or even over-offsetting cloud instances to bridge the end user and traditional Internet services; and 2) estimating and offsetting the carbon emissions from the traditional Internet services. In our paper, we proposed GreenMail, which is a general IMAP proxy caching system that connects email users and traditional email services. GreenMail runs on green web hosts to cache users' emails on green cloud instances. Besides, it offsets the carbon emitted by traditional backend email services.

Emergency response is characterized as a progressive, interactive, and adaptive process that involves parallel activities of processing streaming information and executing response actions. This study develops a dynamic decision support model that adaptively simulates the time-varying emergency environment and tracks changing best health protection response measures at every stage of an emergency in real-time.

For utilities bills and other items, most people have been using the tedious way where a person pay the bill and others transfer the money to their bank account. We research and develop android app as there has been a few companies trying to solve this. Our android application for bills segregation can resolve this problem. In our novel system, the user can create \u201cevent\u201d which represent all events that required to split the payment to everyone. In this application, the user can invite the people and set the rules such as the percentage of each person. More importantly, the users will have the dashboard to display all the event and be able to chat with each other seamlessly. Introduction The document proposed an android application called \u2018Separate Bills\u2019 for people to split their bills such as electric power, water and lunch. The language for developing this application is Kotlin [1]. This document will present the background and summary of this application, introduce the market research and what is my motivation to build this, point out the competitor which already exists in the market. Then this document would deep into the features of the application, list all the assets that would be used to finish this project, and very important analysis my target audience and the UI/UX design with coding concept explains. This document then will analyse features based on the user stories. Finally, will summary of the whole large system and schedule the sprints. Background We are now living in a community, every week we may have several times to hang out or having dinner with friends. However, usually when we pay the fees for dinner or events. We make one person pay for that, and later everyone transfers their part into that person\u2019s bank account. Also, in another situation, not everyone can afford a house to live in, specifically the young generation. So, many people choose to rent a house with others. Therefore, the way they pay the bills such as water, gas and power would be the same as the last situation. This sometimes could be inconvenient. Overview So, my application is designed to overcome this kind of problem. \u2018Separate bills\u2019 can move that action into the digital world to make it more efficient and convenient. It achieves that by creating events with the description of the event (is a dinner check or water bill?), total cost, people that have to pay this event and the \u2018rules\u2019 for this event which is the proportion for everyone. The user can add friends and chat directly in the application and the invitation will be received via message. After the user confirmed an event, it will show on the homepage until the user paid. The user can link multiple cards to pay the bills. Market research and motivation During my research, the restaurant can split the bills for you manually or using technology. Some of the restaurants can provide to manually split bills for customers and these days more and more restaurants are bringing in the technology solution to help them with that. For example, the \u2018SplitAbility Pos\u2019 team provide an IT solution to help restaurants deal with that problem [1]. For the home bills, the payment giant companies such as PayPal, Alipay have their services for split the home bills such as water and gas. Their logic is simple evenly split the amount base among the number of people. The motivation for me to develop this application because as an international student, I am renting a house and share with my friends. So, I faced to split bill situation every month. And, I like to hang out with my friends. We usually had dinner 2~3 times per month before the Covid-19. Every time we split the dinner bills by the traditional way, transfer money to the payer\u2019s bank account. This drives me to find out a solution to solve this problem. Competitor analysis As I mentioned in the market research part, the restaurant and the payment service companies have their solution to overcome in their area. However, their solutions all have limitations. First, on the restaurant side, not all restaurants would update their checking system to compatible with the split bill function, because it costs and not that necessary. Even the restaurants who got this system somethings they are not willing to use, because something called 'time cost\u2019. Thos Weatherby mentioned that in Quora. [2] On the other hand, the payment companies' function to split the home bills. For example, PayPal\u2019s split bill function is inserting the amount and the people them it will automatically evenly generate the cost for each person. I will say it works well and only works for home bills. Also, I believe everyone how is using PayPal must know its fees, painful. So, I believe only the people who use PayPal normally will use that function. My application compares to them has a huge advantage. My application treats everything that needs a split bill as an event. The user can make the rules like the proportion for everyone. And it does not require the business to pay thousands of dollars for a split bill system. Features Asset list The tools would be used in this project: \u2022 Figma: Figma is a vector graphics editor and primarily web-based prototyping tool, so it is very simple to use and very easy to share the prototype with team members or showcase to the customers. \u2022 Font-generator.com: font-generator is a website to generate different font styles for the logo. It is a free website, but it will have a watermark on the image. \u2022 Android Studio: Android Studio is the official integrated development environment for Google's Android operating system. This is an indispensable tool to develop an android application. \u2022 MongoDB: MongoDB is a source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program. MongoDB is also a NoSQL database program. It is free and has cloud containers. \u2022 Kotlin: Kotlin is a modern mobile app programming language that is one of android studio accepts. Compare to Java for beginners, to achieve the same function, Kotlin has much fewer lines to write. Therefore, it is easy to write and debug for beginners. \u2022 Trello: Trello is a web-based, Kanban-style, list-making application. Trello is very useful for project management. I can set few sections such as ToDo, Done and Planned. Setting the estimated start and finish date to manage the project schedule. \u2022 GitHub: GitHub is a website that provides cloud storage and version control for our project via Git. I will use GitHub from the beginning of my project. It helps me to manage my project. \u2022 Android studio emulator: android studio emulator will be used to debug the code in android studio. We can have multiple versions of android and multiple phones emulators. \u2022 Microsoft teams: Teams is a chat software; it will use to communicate with unit staffs for getting help. \u2022 Real android device: android studio provides the function to test the code on real android devices. So, after all works have done it will be used to make sure it can run on real devices. \u2022 Flutter: Flutter is an open-source development kit. I will use flutter to make my interface pretty. \u2022 Visual studio code: VS code is a very friendly coding editor, sometimes I will use it to write code. Product purpose Target audience I think it is obvious in the project introduction. My application\u2019s target audience is the young generation who have not got their own house yet and like to hang out with friends. By using this application, they can do all split fees together including lunch or dinner fees, home bills and any event that must share the price such as tickets to watch football, you name it. Also, they can save time for both themselves and the business such as the restaurant, and they do not have to pay PayPal the high transfer fees. Even more, they can chat with friends in this application, or remainder someone who has not to pay the bill. Unique design and functions My application combined the daily entertainment fees and home bills. There were many solutions for each one of them, however, I think their solutions are expensive and not efficient. Also, I think inside a payment application chat function might be convenient. Imagine if you transfer money to your friend via PayPal and then open up WhatsApp to tell them. Is that a bit complex?

We propose a coarse-grained cellular automata model that simulates vehicles moving on uniform grids whose size are much larger compared with the microscopic cellular automata model. The car-car interaction in the microscopic model is replaced by the coupling between vehicles and coarse-grained state variables in our model. To parameterize the model, flux-occupancy relations are fitted from the historical data at every grids, which serve as the coarse-grained fundamental diagrams coupling the occupancy and speed. To evaluate the model, we feed it with the historical travel demands and trajectories obtained from the floating car data and use the model to predict road speed one hour into the future.

The traffic characteristic analysis in maintenance work zones is a basis for maintenance work zone related research such as layout design, traffic control and safety assessment. Due to the difficulty in vehicle microscopic behaviour data acquisition, traditional traffic characteristic analysis mainly focuses on macroscopic characteristics. With the development of data acquisition technology, it becomes much easier to obtain a large amount of microscopic behaviour data nowadays, which lays a good foundation for analysing the traffic characteristics from a new point of view. This paper puts forward a method for expressing and displaying the vehicle behaviour distribution in maintenance work zones. Using portable vehicle microscopic behaviour data acquisition devices, lots of data can be obtained. Based on this data, an endpoint detection technology is used to automatically extract the segments in behaviour data with violent fluctuations, which are segments where vehicles take behaviours such as acceleration or turning. Using the support vector machine classification method, the specific types of behaviours of the segments extracted can be identified, and together with a data combination method, a total of ten types of behaviours can be identified. Then the kernel density analysis is used to cluster different types of behaviours of all passing vehicles to show the distribution on maps. By this method, how vehicles travel through maintenance work zones, and how different vehicle behaviours distribute in maintenance work zones can be displayed intuitively on maps, which is a novel traffic characteristic and can shed light to maintenance work zone related researches such as safety assessment and design method.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Qun  Yang", "Zhepu  Xu", "Saravanan  Gurupackiam", "Ping  Wang"], "year": 2019, "n_citations": 1}

However, in a variety of applications, knowing the intrinsic VOI of a trajectory is important to guide other subsequent tasks or decisions. This work aims to find a principled framework to quantify the intrinsic VOI of trajectories from the owner's perspective. This is a challenging problem because an appropriate framework needs to take into account various characteristics of the trajectory, prior knowledge, and different types of trajectory degradation. We propose a framework based on information gain (IG) as a principled approach to solve this problem. Our IG framework transforms a trajectory with discrete-time measurements to a canonical representation, i.e., continuous in time with continuous mean and variance estimates, and then quantifies the reduction of uncertainty about the locations of the owner over a period of time as the VOI of the trajectory. Qualitative and extensive quantitative evaluation show that the IG framework is capable of effectively capturing important characteristics contributing to the VOI of trajectories.", "venue": "SIGSPATIAL/GIS", "authors": ["Kien  Nguyen", "John  Krumm", "Cyrus  Shahabi"], "year": 2021, "n_citations": 0}

Since it was introduced by Fagan at IBM in 1976, arguments exist as to which method should be adopted to carry out the exercise, whether it should be paper-based or toolbased, and what reading technique should be used on the inspection document. Extensive works have been done to determine the effectiveness of reviewers in paper-based environment when using ad hoc and checklist reading techniques. In this work, we take the software inspection research further by examining whether there is going to be any significant difference in defect detection effectiveness of reviewers when they use either ad hoc or checklist reading techniques in a distributed groupware environment. Twenty final year undergraduate students of computer science, divided into ad hoc and checklist reviewers groups of ten members each were employed to inspect a mediumsized java code synchronously on groupware deployed on the Internet. The data obtained were subjected to tests of hypotheses using independent t-test and correlation coefficients. Results from the study indicate that there are no significant differences in the defect detection effectiveness, effort in terms of time taken in minutes and false positives reported by the reviewers using either ad hoc or checklist based reading techniques in the distributed groupware environment studied.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Akinola S.

We consider situations where tasks generate jobs that can be provided arbitrary service times before their deadlines, and obtain rewards based on the service times received by the jobs of the task. We show that this model is compatible with the imprecise computation models and the increasing reward with increasing service models. In contrast to previous work on these models, which mainly focus on maximizing the total reward in the system, we additionally aim to fulfill different reward requirements by different tasks. This provides better fairness and also allows fine-grained tradeoff between tasks. We first derive a necessary and sufficient condition for a system with reward requirements of tasks to be feasible. We next obtain an off-line feasibility optimal scheduling policy. We then study a sufficient condition for a policy to be feasibility optimal or achieve some approximation bound. This condition serves as a guideline for designing on-line scheduling policy and we obtain a greedy policy based on it. We prove that the on-line policy is feasibility optimal when all tasks have the same periods, and also obtain an approximation bound for the policy under general cases.

The aim of the current paper is to describe a computer-assisted surgical navigation system based on fluoroscopic X-ray image calibration and three-dimensional optical localizers in order to reduce radiation exposure while increasing accuracy and reliability of the surgical procedure for pedicle screw insertion. Instrumentation using transpedicular screw fixation was performed: in a first group, a conventional surgical procedure was carried out with 26 patients (138 screws); in a second group, a navigated surgical procedure (virtual fluoroscopy) was performed with 26 patients (140 screws). Evaluation of screw placement in every case was done by using plain X-rays and post-operative computer tomography scan. A 5 per cent cortex penetration (7 of 140 pedicle screws) occurred for the computer-assisted group. A 13 per cent penetration (18 of 138 pedicle screws) occurred for the non computer-assisted group. The radiation running time for each vertebra level (two screws) reached 3.5s on average in the computer-assisted group and 11.5s on average in the non computer-assisted group. The operative time for two screws on the same vertebra level reaches 10 min on average in the non computer-assisted group and 11.9 min on average in the computer-assisted group.

Assuming a good initialization technique is available for GEM, we show that the classification performance (in terms of the probability of error) can be greatly improved with multiple sensors compared to that with a single sensor, especially when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is low. We further demonstrate the superior performance of our approach when simulated annealing (SA) with uniform as well as nonuniform grids is employed for initialization of GEM in low SNR regions.

Since senior citizens are at high risk of non communicable diseases requiring long-term care, this trend will challenge the sustainability of the entire health system. Pervasive computing can provide innovative methods and tools for early detecting the onset of health issues. In this paper we propose a novel method to detect abnormal behaviors of elderly people living at home. The method relies on medical models, provided by cognitive neuroscience researchers, describing abnormal activity routines that may indicate the onset of early symptoms of mild cognitive impairment. A non-intrusive sensor-based infrastructure acquires low-level data about the interaction of the individual with home appliances and furniture, as well as data from environmental sensors. Based on those data, a novel hybrid statistical-symbolical technique is used to detect the abnormal behaviors of the patient, which are communicated to the medical center. Differently from related works, our method can detect abnormal behaviors at a fine-grained level, thus providing an important tool to support the medical diagnosis. In order to evaluate our method we have developed a prototype of the system and acquired a large dataset of abnormal behaviors carried out in an instrumented smart home.

Through this, an insight into business suitability within the broader perspective of technique adequacy, is gained. A specific business suitability diagnosis then follows using a particular characterisation of business processing, i.e. one where the intuitive semantics and inter-relationship of business services and business processes are nuanced. As a result, five business suitability principles are elicited. These are proposed for a more detailed understanding and (synthetic) development of workflow modelling techniques. Accordingly, further insight into workflow specification languages and workflow globalisation in open distributed architectures may also be gained. *Part of this work has been supported by CITEC, a business unit of the Queensland Government\u2019s Department of Public Works and Housing (formerly the Administrative Services Department).", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Alistair P.

The objective is to minimize the length of the strip. In this paper, CODP is solved by a series of sub-problems, each corresponding to a fixed strip length. For each sub-problem, an iterated tabu search approach, named ITS, is proposed. ITS starts from a randomly generated solution and attempts to gain improvements by a tabu search procedure. After that, if the obtained solution is not feasible, a perturbation operator is subsequently employed to reconstruct the incumbent solution and an acceptance criterion is implemented to determine whether or not accept the perturbed solution. As a supplementary method, the length of the strip is determined in monotonously decreasing way, with the aid of some post-processing techniques. The search terminates and returns the best found solution after the allowed computation time has been elapsed. Computational experiments based on numerous well-known benchmark instances show that ITS produces quite competitive results, with respect to the best known results, while the computational time remains reasonable for each instance.", "venue": "Eur.

This is deemed significant as yet little research has tackled this important domain from the business intelligence perspective. The D&M IS Success Model was used as a foundational theory and then was refined to match the context of the current research. Importantly, in this study, system quality and information quality constructs were defined on the basis of portals' characteristics since a mapping was conducted between the most significant functions and features of Web portals and quality constructs. The developed framework is deemed useful for theory and practice. From theoretical perspective, the dimensions that affect the perceived quality of Web portals are identified, and the measures that affect each quality dimension are also defined. On the practical level, contributions gained by this study can be observed in terms of the benefits decision makers, strategists, operational employees and IT developers can gain. Assessing portals success in improving task innovation is important to help managers (i.e. decision makers) in making appropriate decisions concerning the adoption of portals' technology, by weighing its benefits against the costs needed to establish and run such a technology. Moreover, assessing Web portals' success gives some insight to IT developers and designers concerning what aspects should be taken when designing and establishing high quality portals, and what functions and features should be contained that would affect the perceived quality of portals and therefore users' intention to use portals. \n \nKeywords: Web Portal, IS Success Model, Delone and Mclean Model, Task Innovation, Business Intelligence, Information Systems.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Dima  Jalal", "Mutaz M.

In the second experiment, we try to capture the temperature gradients using an infrared camera. However, this experiment was inconclusive because of some practical constraints such as the low emissivity of the spreader.

Sometimes, we know in advance that many connections are transitive, and as a consequence, triangles have a specific meaning. Here we propose the study of the modular structure of networks considering triangles as the building blocks of modules. The method generalizes the standard modularity and uses spectral optimization to find its maximum.

The above applications require target tracking for processes and events of interest occurring in an environment. Various methods and approaches have been proposed in order to track one or more targets in a pre-defined area. Usually, this turns out to be a complicated job involving higher order mathematics coupled with artificial intelligence due to the dynamic nature of the targets. To optimize the resources we need to have an approach that works in a more straightforward manner while resulting in fairly satisfactory data. In this paper we have discussed the various cases that might arise while flocking a group of sensors to track targets in a given environment.

Smart homes define optimal consumption as either balancing/leveling consumption using energy storage devices such that the utility company is presented with a uniform demand or as minimizing consumption costs by storing energy during off-peak time periods when prices are lower and use the stored energy during peak time periods when prices are higher. In cost minimization scheme, household is the sole beneficiary and its consumption profile is highly nonuniform and there is no incentive for the utility company to support this scheme. On the other hand, in consumption leveling/balancing scheme there is an incentive for both the household and utility company to support this scheme due to reduction in consumption costs for the former and uniform demand for the latter. Due to varying nature of energy requirements of households and market energy prices over different time periods in a day, households face a tradeoff between consuming to meet their current energy requirements and/or storing energy for future consumption and/or spending energy stored in the past. These tradeoffs are modeled using inter-temporal trade and consumption preferences of households are modeled as utility functions using consumer theory. We introduce two different utility functions, one for cost minimization and another for consumption balancing/leveling, that are maximized subject to certain budget, consumption, storage and savings constraints to solve for the optimum consumption profile. The optimization problem of a household with energy storage is formulated as a geometric program for consumption balancing/leveling, while cost minimization is formulated as a linear programming problem. Simulation results show that the proposed model achieves extremely low peak to average ratio close to 1 with about 8% reduction in consumption costs in consumption balancing/leveling scheme and the least possible amount for the electricity bill with about 12% reduction in consumption costs in cost minimization scheme.", "venue": "IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing", "authors": ["Jayaprakash  Rajasekharan", "Visa  Koivunen"], "year": 2014, "n_citations": 34}

This applies to all domains: from health care and e-government to production and maintenance. Event data are a valuable source of information for organizations that need to meet requirements related to compliance, efficiency, and customer service. Process mining helps to turn these data into real value: by discovering the real processes, by automatically identifying bottlenecks, by analyzing deviations and sources of non-compliance, by revealing the actual behavior of people, etc. Process mining is very different from conventional data mining and machine learning techniques. ProM is a powerful open-source process mining tool supporting hundreds of analysis techniques. However, ProM does not support analysis based on scientific workflows. RapidProM, an extension of RapidMiner based on ProM, combines the best of both worlds. Complex process mining workflows can be modeled and executed easily and subsequently reused for other data sets. Moreover, using RapidProM, one can benefit from combinations of process mining with other types of analysis available through the RapidMiner marketplace.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Wil M.

A central tool in systems theory for synthesizing control laws that achieve stability are control Lyapunov functions (CLFs). Classically, a CLF enforces that the resulting closed-loop state trajectory is contained within a cone with a fixed, predefined shape, and which is centered at and converges to a desired converging point. However, such a requirement often proves to be overconservative, which is why most of the real-time controllers do not have a stability guarantee. Recently, a novel idea that improves the design of CLFs in terms of flexibility was proposed. The focus of this new approach is on the design of optimization problems that allow certain parameters that define a cone associated with a standard CLF to be decision variables. In this way non-monotonicity of the CLF is explicitly linked with a decision variable that can be optimized on-line. Conservativeness is significantly reduced compared to classical CLFs, which makes \\emph{flexible CLFs} more suitable for stabilization of constrained discrete-time nonlinear systems and real-time control. The purpose of this overview is to highlight the potential of flexible CLFs for real-time control of fast mechatronic systems, with sampling periods below one millisecond, which are widely employed in aerospace and automotive applications.", "venue": "FMA", "authors": ["M.

The fabrication process is considered a fixed sequence of well-known steps, which can be purchased from foundries. Simulation models rely on the assumption of ideal process conditions and do not take into account tolerances or intra die variations. Recently there has been discussion that the gap between actual process results and that of predicted models are often out of a tolerable range. This leads to the demand of increased simulation accuracy for the most crucial process steps. The deviations of the comb structures in a resonator, which result from the tolerances in a Deep-RIE process, for example, can make the overall system design fail. To avoid these kinds of errors two things are needed: the technology provider has to know the parameter range of his process and be able to provide it to the designer without loosing his intellectual property. The designer in turn must be provided with a way to use this information to design a system which can perform in the range expected. In this paper we present the latest version of the TCAD environment BICEP3S (Braunschweigs Integrated CAD- Environment for Product Planning and Process Simulation). By using a central process database, which allows the exchange of all relevant process data it is able to overcome many of the mentioned obstacles. The database and process planning tool can be used by process developers to document changes in process settings and the influence of such changes on the process result. This information can then be used by the designers to set-up a simulation file for a detailed analysis of the impact of such parameter changes on the requested design.

Efficient coverage optimization requires accurate coverage estimation. This estimation relies on geo-located field measurements that are gathered today during highly expensive drive tests (DT) and will be reported in the near future by users\u2019 mobile devices thanks to the Third-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) minimization of drive tests (MDT) feature. This feature consists of an automatic reporting of the radio measurements associated with the geographic location of the user's mobile device. Such a solution is still costly in terms of battery consumption and signaling overhead. Therefore, predicting the coverage on a location where no measurements are available remains a key and challenging task.

This paper focuses on the reduction of the computational complexity of the Kriging algorithm by applying fixed rank Kriging (FRK). The performance evaluation of the FRK algorithm both on simulated measurements and real field measurements shows a good tradeoff between prediction efficiency and computational complexity.

These two aspects are the changes in the structure of organizations and the epistemology of Information Systems Development. Firstly, the conception of business processes within the management of organizations increases the structural complexity of Information Systems, because existing systems have to be integrated into a coherent cross-functional architecture. Secondly, process thinking leads to a particular view of organizations that ultimately has a negative effect on the support of Information Systems. As an illustration of process thinking, the Business Process Reengineering movement adheres to a technocratic management perspective of organizations. Particularly this conception of organization views people as mechanisms to realize certain organizational goals. As a result of this view stakeholders are confronted with the implemented systems, rather than consulted about the scope and functionality of those systems. Therefore, both aspects of process thinking have a negative impact on the success of IT projects. The problem of structural complexity is an area that is addressed by Enterprise Application Integration, and mainly requires technical solutions. However, the problems associated with the conception of organization require a different, markedly non-technical, perspective. Several directions are discussed to overcome some limitations of process thinking, but these directions are merely small pointers.

With some tradeoffs specified in form of weight, these services will be made available to the user for consideration. This assertion is from the fact that, the user's requirements for the specified QoS properties are of varying degree i.e. he will always prefer one ahead of the other. This can be captured in form of weight i.e. the one preferred most will have the highest weight.

As a result, it has become a great challenge for physical layout designers to design a standard cell layout that is optimized for area, power, timing, signal integrity, and printability. Multiple design iterations are required to consider pin accessibility during standard cells layout to increase the number of feasible solutions available to the router. In this work, we will demonstrate several improvements with the Synopsys PAC methodology, such as reducing the number of cells required for each Synopsys 'testcell' with the same cell abutment condition, increasing the complexity of the pin connection for better pin accessibility evaluation. We also recommend additional constraints to improve the probability of detecting pin accessibility issues.

Mumbai, one of the most crowded cities in the world, has witnessed both the largest number of cases and deaths among all the cities in India (41986 positive cases and 1368 deaths as of 02 June 2020).

As discussed in IISc-TIFR Report 1, ABCS is a useful tool to model interactions of city residents at an individual level and to capture the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions on the infection spread. In this report we focus on Mumbai. Using our simulator, we consider some plausible scenarios for phased emergence of Mumbai from the lockdown, 01 June 2020 onwards.

A Systematic Literature Review of Meta-Models in BPM", "abstract": "Business process modelling languages typically enable the representation of business process models by employing (graphical) symbols. These symbols can vary depending upon the verbosity of the language, the modeling paradigm, the focus of the language, and so on. To make explicit the different constructs and rules employed by a specific language as well as bridge the gap across different languages, meta-models have been proposed in literature. These meta-models are a crucial source of knowledge on what state-of-the-art literature considers relevant to describe business processes. Moreover, the rapid growth of techniques and tools that aim at supporting all dimensions of business processes and not only its control flow perspective, as for instance data and organisational aspects, makes even more important to have a clear idea, already at the conceptual level, of the key process constructs. The goal of this work is to provide the first extensive systematic literature review (SLR) of business process meta-models. This SLR aims at answering research questions concerning: (i) the kind of meta-models proposed in literature; (ii) the recurring constructs they contain; (iii) their purposes; and (iv) their evaluations. Thirty-six papers were selected and evaluated against four research questions. The results indicate the existence of a reasonable body of work conducted in this specific area, but not a full maturity. In particular, while traditional paradigms towards business process modelling, and aspects related to the business process control flow seem to be well present, novel paradigms and aspects related to the organisational, data and goal-oriented aspects of business processes seem to be still under-investigated.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Greta  Adamo", "Chiara  Ghidini", "Chiara Di Francescomarino"], "year": 2019, "n_citations": 5}

Existing approaches to identify urban areas normally based on midresolution sensing dataset, socioeconomic information (e.g. population density) generally associate with low-resolution in space, e.g. cells with several square kilometers or even larger towns/wards. Yet, few of them pay attention to defining urban areas with micro data in a fine-scaled manner with large extend scale by incorporating the morphological and functional characteristics. This paper investigates an automated framework to delineate urban areas in the parcel level, using increasingly available ordnance surveys for generating all parcels (or geo-units) and ubiquitous points of interest (POIs) for inferring density of each parcel. A vector cellular automata model was adopted for identifying urban parcels from all generated parcels, taking into account density, neighborhood condition, and other spatial variables of each parcel. We applied this approach for mapping urban areas of all 654 Chinese cities and compared them with those interpreted from mid-resolution remote sensing images and inferred by population density and road intersections. Our proposed framework is proved to be more straight-forward, time-saving and fine-scaled, compared with other existing ones, and reclaim the need for consistency, efficiency and availability in defining urban areas with well-consideration of omnipresent spatial and functional factors across cities.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Ying  Long", "Yao  Shen"], "year": 2014, "n_citations": 7}

This article contributes with an exact multiobjective approach to solve the waste bin location in which the optimization criteria that are considered are: the accessibility to the system (as quality of service measure), the investment cost, and the required frequency of waste removal from the bins (as a proxy of the posterior routing costs). In this approach, different methods to obtain the objectives ideal and nadir values over the Pareto front are proposed and compared. Then, a family of heuristic methods based on the PageRank algorithm is proposed which aims to optimize the accessibility to the system, the amount of collected waste and the installation cost.

Maintaining these rich histories requires frequent sampling and indexed storage of spatiotemporal data that pushes the limits of resource-constrained mobile devices. Today's apps offload processing and storing contextual information, but this increases response time, often relies on the user's data connection, and runs the very real risk of revealing sensitive information. In this paper, we motivate the feasibility of on-loading large amounts of context and introduce Programming Abstraction for Contextual On-loading (Paco), an architecture for on-loading data that optimizes for location and time while allowing flexibility in storing additional context. The Paco API's innovations enable on-loading very dense traces of information, even given devices\u2019 resource constraints. Using real-world traces and our implementation for Android, we demonstrate that Paco can support expressive application queries entirely on-device. Our quantitative evaluation assesses Paco's energy consumption, execution time, and spatiotemporal query accuracy. Further, Paco facilitates unified contextual reasoning across multiple applications and also supports user-controlled release of contextual data to other devices or the cloud; we demonstrate these assets through a proof-of-concept case study.", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing", "authors": ["Nathaniel  Wendt", "Christine  Julien"], "year": 2018, "n_citations": 5}

Since modern embedded applications become more complex with dynamic behavior changes at runtime, several extensions of the SDF model have been proposed to specify the dynamic behavior changes while preserving static analyzability of the SDF model. They assume that an application has a finite number of behaviors (or modes), and each behavior (mode) is represented by an SDF graph. They are classified as multi-mode dataflow models in this article. While there exist several scheduling techniques for multi-mode dataflow models, no one allows task migration between modes. By observing that the resource requirement can be additionally reduced if task migration is allowed, we propose a multiprocessor scheduling technique of a multi-mode dataflow graph considering task migration between modes. Based on a genetic algorithm, the proposed technique schedules all SDF graphs in all modes simultaneously to minimize the resource requirement. To satisfy the throughput constraint, the proposed technique calculates the actual throughput requirement of each mode and the output buffer size for tolerating throughput jitter. We compare the proposed technique with a method that analyzes SDF graphs in each execution mode separately, a method that does not allow task migration, and a method that does not allow mode-overlapped schedule for synthetic examples and five real applications: H.264 decoder, lane detection, vocoder, MP3 decoder, and printer pipeline.", "venue": "ACM Trans.

The precise charting and measurement of such canalization simplifies these models, making even very large networks amenable to analysis.

While man-made systems often employ intricate structural solutions to overcome noise, the structure of many biological systems is more amorphous. It is not well understood how communication noise may affect the computational repertoire of such groups. To approach this question we consider the basic collective task of rumor spreading, in which information from few knowledgeable sources must reliably flow into the rest of the population. \nIn order to study the effect of communication noise on the ability of groups that lack stable structures to efficiently solve this task, we consider a noisy version of the uniform PULL model. We prove a lower bound which implies that, in the presence of even moderate levels of noise that affect all facets of the communication, no scheme can significantly outperform the trivial one in which agents have to wait until directly interacting with the sources. Our results thus show an exponential separation between the uniform PUSH and PULL communication models in the presence of noise. Such separation may be interpreted as suggesting that, in order to achieve efficient rumor spreading, a system must exhibit either some degree of structural stability or, alternatively, some facet of the communication which is immune to noise. \nWe corroborate our theoretical findings with a new analysis of experimental data regarding recruitment in Cataglyphis niger desert ants.", "venue": "ITCS", "authors": ["Lucas  Boczkowski", "Ofer  Feinerman", "Amos  Korman", "Emanuele  Natale"], "year": 2018, "n_citations": 10}

The unique behaviour of the MOS transistors in subthreshold region not only allows a designer to work at low input bias current but also at low voltage. While operating the device at weak inversion results low power dissipation but dynamic range is degraded. Optimum balance between power dissipation and dynamic range results when the MOS transistors are operated at moderate inversion. Power is again minimised by the application of input dependant bias current using feedback loops in the input transistors of the differential pair with two current substractors. In comparison with the reported low power low voltage opamps at 0.8 micron technology, this opamp has very low standby power consumption with a high driving capability and operates at low voltage. The opamp is fairly small (0.0084 mm 2) and slew rate is more than other low power low voltage opamps reported at 0.8 um technology [1,2]. Vittoz at al [3] reported that slew rate can be improved by adaptive biasing technique and power dissipation can be reduced by operating the device in weak inversion. Though lower power dissipation is achieved the area required by the circuit is very large and speed is too small. So, operating the device in moderate inversion is a good solution.

When simulating urban driving scenarios, simulation maps are one important component. Often, the generation of those road networks is a time consuming and manual effort. Furthermore, typically many variations of a distinct junction or road section are demanded to ensure that an ADF can be validated in the process of releasing those functions to the public. Therefore, in this paper, we present a prototypical solution for a logical road network description which is easy to maintain and modify. The concept aims to be non-redundant so that changes of distinct quantities do not affect other places in the code and thus the variation of maps is straightforward.

However, despite research thrusts explored since the late 1990's, to date no standard, generalizable solutions have emerged for effectively integrating and processing multimodal data, and consequently practitioners across a wide variety of disciplines must still follow a trial-and-error process to identify the optimum procedure for each individual application and data sources. A deeper understanding of the utility and capabilities (as well as the shortcomings and challenges) of existing multimodal data fusion methods as a function of data and challenge characteristics has the potential to deliver better data analysis tools across all sectors, therein enabling more efficient and effective automated manufacturing, patient care, infrastructure maintenance, environmental understanding, transportation networks, energy systems, etc. There is therefore an urgent need to identify the underlying patterns that can be used to determine a priori which techniques will be most useful for any specific dataset or application. This next stage of understanding and discovery (i.e., the development of generalized solutions) can only be achieved via a high level cross-disciplinary aggregation of learnings, and this workshop was proposed at an opportune time as many domains have already started exploring use of multimodal data fusion techniques in a wide range of application-specific contexts.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Chun-An  Chou", "Xiaoning  Jin", "Amy  Mueller", "Sarah  Ostadabbas"], "year": 2018, "n_citations": 0}

The scope of the engagement was to establish a standard set of processes based on CMMI\\textregistered and ITIL\\textregistered Framework across four business verticals scattered in Europe, United States and Asia. The services of Software Quality Analyst (SQA) from different vendors were leveraged to facilitate implementation of processes which was referred to as the Quality Management System (QMS). To co-ordinate and support QMS implementation, a Software Quality Assurance Group (SQAG) was established at the organizational level. Considering the large number of applications, the business verticals proposed that process implementation should be owned and managed by practitioners themselves so that the mass deployment of QMS can be achieved at a faster rate with the same SQA capacity. This called for a need to devise an innovative implementation solution before moving to a process implementation model which proposed Project Managers implementing processes themself. While there are process models and frameworks available in the market for establishing processes in an organization, there is no model that elaborates activities to be performed by the SQA for effective implementation of processes. SQA service maturity model was proposed as a solution based on CMMI\\textregistered and developed to eventually proceed towards a 'Process Implementation Model proposing Project Managers implementing processes themself'. \nSQA Service Maturity Model is a Software Quality Assurance implementation framework that enables organisations to increase Efficiencies in Software Quality Assurance, reduce the Cost of Defects and ultimately Increasing Return on Investment in IT.", "venue": "ICIT 2012", "authors": ["G.

As the suppliers seek to secure their intellectual property (IP) rights, the customer usually has no direct access to the suppliers\u2019 source code, and is able to enforce the use of verification tools only by legal requirements. In turn, the supplier has no means to convince the customer about successful verification without revealing the source code. This article presents an approach to resolve the conflict between the IP interests of the supplier and the quality interests of the customer. We introduce a protocol in which a dedicated server (called the \u201camanat\u201d) is controlled by both parties: the customer controls the verification task performed by the amanat, while the supplier controls the communication channels of the amanat to ensure that the amanat does not leak information about the source code. We argue that the protocol is both practically useful and mathematically sound. As the protocol is based on well-known (and relatively lightweight) cryptographic primitives, it allows a straightforward implementation on top of existing verification tool chains. To substantiate our security claims, we establish the correctness of the protocol by cryptographic reduction proofs.", "venue": "TSEM", "authors": ["Sagar  Chaki", "Christian  Schallhart", "Helmut  Veith"], "year": 2013, "n_citations": 5}

On the one hand these fine-grained measurements will lead to an improvement in costumers' energy habits, but on the other hand the fined-grained data produces information about a household and also households' inhabitants, which are the basis for many future privacy issues. To ensure household privacy and smart meter information owned by the household inhabitants, load hiding techniques were introduced to obfuscate the load demand visible at the household energy meter. In this work, a state-of-the-art battery-based load hiding (BLH) technique, which uses a controllable battery to disguise the power consumption and a novel load hiding technique called load-based load hiding (LLH) are presented. An LLH system uses an controllable household appliance to obfuscate the household's power demand.

With increased population and complex roles regarding their inhabitants and their surroundings, cities concentrate difficulties for design, planning and analysis. These tasks require a way to reconstruct/model a city. Traditionally, much attention has been given to buildings reconstruction, yet an essential part of city were neglected: streets. Streets reconstruction has been seldom researched. Streets are also complex compositions of urban features, and have a unique role for transportation (as they comprise roads). We aim at completing the recent state of the art for building reconstruction (Musialski2012) by considering all other aspect of urban reconstruction. We introduce the need for city models. Because reconstruction always necessitates data, we first analyse which data are available. We then expose a state of the art of street reconstruction, street network reconstruction, urban features reconstruction/modelling, vegetation , and urban objects reconstruction/modelling. \nAlthough reconstruction strategies vary widely, we can order them by the role the model plays, from data driven approach, to model-based approach, to inverse procedural modelling and model catalogue matching. The main challenges seems to come from the complex nature of urban environment and from the limitations of the available data. Urban features have strong relationships, between them, and to their surrounding, as well as in hierarchical relations. Procedural modelling has the power to express these relations, and could be applied to the reconstruction of urban features via the Inverse Procedural Modelling paradigm.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["R\u00e9mi  Cura", "Julien  Perret", "Nicolas  Paparoditis"], "year": 2018, "n_citations": 1}

The technique combines Singular Value Thresholding (SVT) based Matrix Completion (MC) procedure with the Direct Data Domain (D^3) based Matrix Pencil (MP) Method. When the element failure is observed, first, the MC is performed to recover the missing data from failed elements, and then the MP method is used to estimate the DOAs. We also, propose a very simple technique to detect the location of elements failed, which is required to perform MC procedure. We provide simulation studies to demonstrate the performance and usefulness of the proposed technique.

The basic mathematical tool used for emotion recognition is Pattern recognition which involves three operations, namely, pre-processing, feature extraction and classification. This paper introduces a procedure for emotion recognition using Hidden Markov Models (HMM), which is used to divide five emotional states: anger, surprise, happiness, sadness and neutral state. The approach is based on standard speech recognition technology using hidden continuous markov model by selection of low level features and the design of the recognition system. Emotional Speech Database from Telugu Rural Dialects of Andhra Pradesh (TRDAP) was designed using several speaker's voices comprising the emotional states. The accuracy of recognizing five different emotions for both genders of classification is 80% for anger-emotion which is achieved by using the best combination of 39-dimensioanl feature vector for every frame (13 MFCCs, 13 Delta Coefficients and 13 Acceleration Coefficients) and a classifier using HMM.

The methods for this task can be categorized into two broad groups: intensity-based and object-based interpolation methods. While intensity-based methods are generally easier to perform and less computationally expensive, object-based methods are capable of producing more accurate results and account for deformable changes in the objects within the slices. In this paper, performance of two well-known object-based interpolation methods is analyzed and compared. Here, a deformable registration-based method specifically designed for medical applications and a learning-based method, trained for video frame interpolation, are considered. While the deformable registration-based technique is capable of accurate modeling of the changes in the shapes of the objects within slices, the learning-based method is able to produce results with similar accuracy, but with a much sharper appearance in a fraction of the time. This is despite the fact that the learning-based approach is not trained on medical images and rather is trained using regular video footage.

Retailers that serve a large customer base spend a lot of money and resources to stay prepared for meeting changing fashion demands, and incur huge losses in unsold inventory and liquidation costs [2]. This problem has been addressed by analysts and statisticians as well as ML researchers in a conventional fashion - of building models that forecast for future demand given a particular item of fashion with historical data on its sales. To our knowledge, none of these models have generalized well to predict future demand at an abstracted level for a new design/style of fashion article. To address this problem, we present a study of large scale fashion sales data and directly infer which clothing/footwear attributes and merchandising factors drove demand for those items.

Media such as sand, soil, gravel, food stuffs, pharmaceuticals, etc. all have similar irregular flow since they are composed of numerous small solid particles. In video games, simulating these materials increases immersion and can be used for various game mechanics. Computationally, full scale simulation is not typically feasible except on the most powerful hardware and tends to be reduced in priority to favor other, more integral, gameplay features. Here we study the computational and qualitative aspects of side profile flow of sand-like particles using cellular automata (CA). Our CA uses a standard square lattice that updates via a custom, modified Margolus neighborhood. Each update occurs using a set of probabilistic transitions that can be tuned to simulate friction between particles. We focus on the look of the sandpile structure created from an hourglass shape over time using different transition probabilities and the computational impact of such a simulation. The toppling behavior and final structure of the sandpiles are largely dependent on the chosen probabilities. As the probability to topple decreases, representing greater friction, elongated sandpiles begin to form, leading to longer settling times.", "venue": "Comput.

Bennett (1988) seems to capture, at least partially, the notion of organized complexity, so central in big history. More precisely, the increase in organized complexity refers here to the wealth, variety and intricacy of structures, and should not be confused with the increase of random complexity, formalized by Kolmogorov (1965). If Bennett is right in proposing to assimilate organized complexity with \"computational content\", then the fundamental cause of the increase of complexity in the universe is the existence of computing mechanisms with memory, and able to cumulatively create and preserve computational contents. In this view, the universe computes, remembers its calculations, and reuses them to conduct further computations. Evolutionary mechanisms are such forms of cumulative computation with memory and we owe them the organized complexity of life. Language, writing, culture, science and technology can also be analyzed as computation mechanisms generating, preserving and accelerating the increase in organized complexity. The main unifying theme for big history is the energy rate density, a metric based on thermodynamics. However useful, this metric does not provide much insight into the role that information and computation play in our universe. The concept of \"logical depth\" provides a new lens to examine the increase of organized complexity. We argue in this paper that organized complexity is a valid and useful way to make sense of big history. Additionally, logical depth has a rigorous formal definition in theoretical computer science that hints at a broader research program to quantify complexity in the universe. \nKeywords: organized complexity, Kolmogorov complexity, logical depth, big history, cosmic evolution, evolution, complexity, complexification, computation, artificial life, philosophy of information", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Jean-Paul  Delahaye", "Clement  Vidal"], "year": 2016, "n_citations": 6}

We present a simple mathematical analysis framework for the EDCA function. Our analysis considers the fact that the distributed random access systems exhibit cyclic behavior where each station successfully transmits a packet in a cycle.

To achieve this both the definition of CVT and XOR are modified over the set of multiple integers instead of two. Also some important properties of these operations have been studied.

The microcontroller has a 10-bit Analog Digital Converting accuracy that is one of the important criteria for this design as it is going to be used for medical purposes. As the project concentrates more on designing software than hardware, the EasyPIC4 development board was used which comes with all hardware required for this project. The Jackson diagram method was used to design and implement the coding program for the microcontroller software part of the system. The MikroC IDE has been used to compile and load the program into PIC18F4550 microcontroller. The program for the microcontroller uses C language that aims to keep the USB link alive by using interrupt function. A sensor collects data from sensor as 4 bits and send it to the PC every second using a USB cable. The data received from sensor, will be sent by microcontroller to the PC. The Visual Basic software was used in the PC side of device to catch and output the data on the screen. A template file for the Visual Basic program was generated by Easy HID wizard to make software programming part easier for designer.

Process mining receives so-called process logs which are collections of partially-ordered events. An event has to possess at least three attributes, case ID, task ID and a timestamp for mining approaches to work. When a case ID is unknown, the event is called unlabeled. Traditionally, process mining is an offline task, where events are collected from different sources are usually manually correlated. That is, events belonging to the same instance are assigned the same case ID. With today's high-volume/high-speed nature of, e.g., IoT applications, process mining shifts to be an online task. For this, event correlation has to be automated and has to occur as the data is generated. In this paper, we introduce an approach that correlates unlabeled events at runtime. Given a process model, a stream of unlabeled events and other information about task duration, our approach can induce a case identifier to a set of unlabeled events with a trust percentage. It can also check the conformance of the identified cases with the process model.

The projection space obtained provides the basis to the analysis of measurements. This quantitative measures underlie revealing observations about the evolution of painting styles, specially when compared with other humanity fields already analyzed: while music evolved along a master-apprentice tradition (high dialectics) and philosophy by opposition, painting presents another pattern: constant increasing skewness, low opposition between members of the same movement and opposition peaks in the transition between movements. Differences between baroque and modern movements are also observed in the projected \"painting space\": while baroque paintings are presented as an overlapped cluster, the modern paintings present minor overlapping and are disposed more widely in the projection than the baroque counterparts.

The resultant 'device shrinking' reduces the soft error tolerance of the VLSI circuits, as very little energy is needed to change their states. Safety critical systems are very sensitive to soft errors. A bit flip due to soft error can change the value of critical variable and consequently the system control flow can completely be changed which leads to system failure. To minimize soft error risks, a novel methodology is proposed to detect and recover from soft errors considering only 'critical code blocks' and 'critical variables' rather than considering all variables and/or blocks in the whole program.

Estimating the average loss from the exclusive use of the Classical Form Representation also shows that the use of alternatives yields significant benefits in some parameters, this can be used to optimize devices in the logic design process and reduce the chip area, what also contributes to reductions in the cost of such devices.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Sergii  Kushch"], "year": 2018, "n_citations": 0}

In the present study, the geometry of the tunnel roof is assumed semi-circular which is covered with a UV (200\\mu) stabilized polyethylene film. The simulated SGTD reduces moisture of copra from 52.2% to 8% in 55 h under full load conditions. A system of partial differential equations describing heat and moisture transfer during drying copra in the solar greenhouse dryer was developed and this system of non-linear partial differential equations was solved numerically using the finite difference method (FDM). The numerical solution was programmed in Compaq Visual FORTRAN version 6.5. The simulated results reasonably agreed with the experimental data for solar drying copra. This model can be used to provide the design data and is also essential for optimal design of the dryer. For instance the user is able to change the radiation properties of the roof cover for different materials of roof cover.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["S.  Sadodin", "T. T.

Important bone landmarks and joint rotation axes are identified from the extracted meshes. A script-based framework is developed to provide a graphical user interface that can visualize, resample and modify the meshes to fit different subject scales. \nConclusion This open-data resource fills a gap in available data and is provided for free usage in research and other applications.

The majority of sensor selection algorithms find the subset of sensors that best recovers an arbitrary signal from a number of linear measurements that is larger than the dimension of the signal. In this paper, we develop a new sensor selection algorithm for sparse (or near sparse) signals that finds a subset of sensors that best recovers such signals from a number of measurements that is much smaller than the dimension of the signal. Existing sensor selection algorithms cannot be applied in such situations. Our proposed Incoherent Sensor Selection (Insense) algorithm minimizes a coherence-based cost function that is adapted from recent results in sparse recovery theory. Using three datasets, including a real-world dataset on microbial diagnostics, we demonstrate the superior performance of Insense for sparse-signal sensor selection.", "venue": "ICASSP", "authors": ["Amirali  Aghazadeh", "Mohammad  Golbabaee", "Andrew S.

Such a program require monitoring of end-use appliances energy consumption in real-time. The worldwide recent adoption of smart-meter in smart-grid, has led to the rise of Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM); which enables estimation of appliance-specific power consumption from building's aggregate power consumption reading. NILM provides households with cost-effective real-time monitoring of end-use appliances to help them understand their consumption pattern and become part and parcel of energy conservation strategy. This paper presents an up to date overview of NILM system and its associated methods and techniques for energy disaggregation problem. This is followed by the review of the state-of-the art NILM algorithms. Furthermore, we review several performance metrics used by NILM researcher to evaluate NILM algorithms and discuss existing benchmarking framework for direct comparison of the state of the art NILM algorithms.

This paper focuses on an emerging component of the integrated marketing communication, ie. social media networking, as it is increasingly becoming the trend. In 21st century, the marketing communication platforms show a tendency to shift towards innovative technology bound people networking which is becoming an acceptable domain of interaction. Though the traditional channels like TV, print media etc. are still active and prominent in marketing communication, the presences of the Internet and more specifically the Social Media Networking, has started influencing the way individuals and business enterprises communicate. It has become evident that more individuals and business enterprises are engaging the social media networking sites either to accelerate the sales of their products and services or to provide post-purchase feedbacks. This shift in scenario has motivated this research which took six months (June 2011 - December 2011), using empirical analysis which is carried out based on several primary and secondary evidences. The research paper also analyzes the factors that govern the social media networking sites to influence consumers and subsequently enable their purchase decisions. The secondary data presented for this research were those pertaining to the period between the year 2005 and year 2011.

Hybrid computing systems which combine probabilistic and deterministic processors can provide robust and efficient tools for computational problems that hitherto would be intractable by conventional deterministic algorithm. These developments suggest a revised perspective on the consequences of ion-channel noise in slender axons, often regarded as a hindrance to neuronal computations. It is proposed that the human brain is such an energy-efficient hybrid computational system whose remarkable characteristics emerge from constructive synergies between probabilistic and deterministic modes of operation. In particular, the capacity for intuition and creative problem solving appears to arise naturally from such a hybrid system. Bearing in mind that physical thermal noise is both pure and available at no cost, our proposal has implications for attempts to emulate the energy-efficient human brain on conventional energy-intensive deterministic supercomputers.", "venue": "ArXiv", "authors": ["Tim N.
